You We all have different countries, if we are to be one of them, we have to deal with the risks. We have come from the middle of this. We have a group of people there. We have a group of people in Batia. But on the one hand, when we are on our way, we have a group of people who want to be on our way. We have a group of people who want to be on our way. We have got certain goals. Our friends are getting their guidance through Turkey. We have not received the degree of unanimity. We have to know that we are in a world where we can't find a way out. In the world of Turkish, we can't tell the difference between human and human beings. We don't talk about the world of Turkish people. But the Mimhan Barber has done his own Turkish people. He has done Turkish people, and he has done Turkish people. ...but he has said that all the members of the whole world are interested in this integrated community. We are interested in the current situation, but there are times when we have problems between the people and the world... ...of the Turkish world. It is now important to consider this issue in the international community. Here, we have learned the importance of the Turkish world. and that we call it the modern history of the Caucasus. We call it the city of Turkey. We call it the city of China, it is a great opportunity to meet with our audience. When we are in a crisis, we have a great opportunity, we have economic capacity, we have a great capacity and we have a great opportunity to meet with our audience. In the present period, and in the present period, we had a new issue. In 1991, the URS had to be more cumbersome. First, the media was more likely to be affected by more than 300. In the beginning of the century, the state was established. Then, you know that the state of Ulus is very difficult. But we are trying to make a new issue. First, we understand the world. First, we understand the social welfare system, we understand the culture and the social welfare system. Second, we understand the social welfare system. The social welfare system, the people who are able to achieve the right, ...a powerful market... ...and a potential to think... ...and to think about energy market... ...and to think about it. To think about the top, to think about it... ...and to think about it. They say that it has been a huge problem. They say it has been a big problem. They said that the US and the US... ...have been in a massive conflict. We can actually get the attention of the international community. We cannot solve our problems. Because we are working very hard. If you are able to control the world, you will be able to control the world. You will be able to reach the goal. What will happen to the world's future? If you are able to bring the world to the end, what is the mechanism? What is the real mechanism? I think it is very important to have a very strong connection. We are doing the patina. We need to get people out of the way, we need to make sure they are safe and safe. We need to keep finding ways to communicate with the government, we need to make sure we are safe and safe. Now, this is the end of this week's talk with a discussion we cannot discuss. We are talking about partnership at the end of this week. We are talking about the specific classes we have on this week and we cannot monitor their asks and actions with their specific classes. We call this global economy as a part of the world, because this is the process of no use of any work, we call it a state of 18 million. However, we don't even know it as an alpha and a kind of work. We don't even know how to work with the government. We don't know how to work with the government, but we don't know how to work with the same kind of work. We don't know how to work with the same kind of work. In the end, we only say good things and say good things. We can't do good things after that beautiful story. At that time, people who were killed in this matter were killed in this matter. They were killed in this matter, and they were killed in this matter. One of them is saying that, in the middle of the 5th century, we tried to find a solution to the problem of society. We tried to deal with it, but it didn't work. He does not have anyone who is he too important to me. He can't do it. He has a genius. He doesn't have anyone who knows. So, he does it with the people of China... ...with his own people. With the voice of his people, he has the talent of education. But he's very intelligent and good, and he has the ability to work with you. He does it with our people. In Turkey, he works with the people of Turkey. But who he does? Let's talk about it. Now we have come to the beautiful areas. I will continue here a little more. We have our own stories. I am also living. I am talking as a Turkish milleer. I am talking as a man who works in Turkish history for a year. Now I am looking at history. The history of the Turkish people, the history of life, the image of the Gaznel. Then, we have a story. As a Ottoman, a Turkish milleer. How to sleep? Two. This is all Turkish. The door is empty. Let's go back. There are 4 other Harbs in the house. Karan, Selcan, Çuklubeş. we all move our heads when it comes to a new state. We are saying, we progress so far, so it's been up to here. Where is our first goal? We also secured our history. We are all involved in our part. We have some stuff. I've been to CS its place. I think the government has been doing some things for the rest of the years. I've been living in a different world. I think it's not a real world. I've been waiting a lot. I've been saying that Russian will kill the world for a lot of time. Doesn't need as many children as you see down the table. So you're looking at it gradually. He's so wisdom. Thank you. All the children daily stay. By the way, you said you wanted to have reactions. I don't have that many books about those people. But you looked around a little. I'm not saying that every part of the country has a different way of saying it to me. That's why, as you said in the last episode, we couldn't get out of that book. Now, this is the end of the story. We have a lot of economic benefits. There are technologies in these countries. There are many countries in the world. There are strategic areas in Turkey. It's like you said in Europe. From there, I was able to get rid of all of them. It's a lot of economic benefits. But what are the benefits? First of all, we have a lot of benefits. We have a lot of benefits. I don't give any credit to Turkey. I don't give any credit to everyone. Let's have a little bit of a lot of information. Self-reliant, self-reliant. Self-reliant is non-pocha. If you don't know a country that's not in Turkey, you don't give any credit to any government. These countries are in the same country. The idea is that, these countries are small. in the last year. In the last year, the 40-year-old was in the 40th year, and a group of people who are in the military for the first time, we have to see the capacity of the economy. We have returned to the 90s with the economic values. We have returned to the 90s. We have returned to the 20th, 25th, 30th, In two hours, we made patinaj. We thought that we would be able to get the information we received from our family. We used to use that information until now. There were many questions about 20 years ago. Now, we need to talk about something else. There are a lot of things that we don't want to talk about for the first time in 2020. In 2023, we have a lot of plans. For example, we will come back with 100 years. So, we will come back with the 5th anniversary of Istanbul. Until now, for example, we will come back with a 1st year anniversary of annadur. We will come back with a 950 year. It will be a 9.73 year. But I didn't understand what the ruckus was addressing with the rights of people. People who are asking about the rights of people don't respond to anything else. I don't understand where to start from with the pass, which is 20 years. It is 20 years, maybe 90 years more. No, we have a 10-year old son, who will be in the 30th year. But I think the reality is that tariff was the only thing that made up the history. We are trying to hold on to the rules. What are the rules? In fact, to bring this life to the rules of life, we should be able to get rid of the rules of the rules. It is not the rules that came to the rules. It is the rules of the rules. That is why I can say that if we keep all this world, we need to protect this. I mean, we need to protect this. There is a program called Turkey. We talk about the rules and other rules that we talk about to our viewers. We do not have any rules. We do not have any rules for that. This is a rule of the rule of the rule of the state and the state. This is an issue of the rules and our historical issues. We have rules and regulations. The rules of the rules of human history. This is a website for those who have been subscribed to the website. What did they say? What is the meaning of the mosque? The name of the name of the mosque is himself in the Politics Law. For the creation of the mosque, this was the next one. There is the tomb of the spiritual Soul. Everything we talk about here. If you want to talk about it, I can see that you came and came. What did you start to invest in it? You have become a great role. But in our hands, we can say that we are God's own, we are determined, we are determined, we are determined and we don't have a strategy. That is why, for us, this is a very important thing that we have in our country. This is the reason why I think that we can say that we are able to say that we are capable of doing what we want to do. We see that you are right and we see that we are capable of doing what we want to do. But once we do what we want to do, we will see the benefits of life and the solutions we are facing. So, we won't tell our greatest words, we will work hard to do it. Everyone says that you are capable of doing what you want to do. It is not easy to do what you want to do. Mr. Zaman, as you said in the last time, as the Prime Minister stated, the government and the administration, all of us should have done this well. We are not looking for people who are weak and are not doing what we are doing. We are trying to kill people who are weak. We have seen that people can't tell us the truth. In the end, we are trying to reduce the economy. First, we are trying to reduce the economy. They could be.. They would have been able to make us all the way up to the core. But on the tip of the mind, You know, it is worth to bring out the people who are in a situation that can be considered as the opposite. The fact that people can be considered as the opposite to people who are in a state of danger. We have shown that good speech and verbal techniques are really necessary. That is why, the best words and verbal techniques are There is a political view right now. That's why I saw people like Azar Baycan in Azerbaijan. I've always been in Azerbaijan. When you look at the streets, you can see a child. You can see the hospital. You can see a child with a political view. You say, how do you do this much? We don't use this mechanism. We're carrying out all the problems in the city. Therefore to set up new VietnamLaughs, our crews will be independent. Anyone Department of Research will use these plans. We will need to organize the protection plan for the whole democratic world. We are taking this path to it and we will have to resolve this new status. This is why in this world, while working on itself, we are hard to comprehend and disseminate with the countries you are living in using technology to deter our needs of those who are living in indap或 respect, sense strategy, that we will be flexible. This is not the way we are. We will be able to do things that are good for the country. We will have a sense of this. We are trying to take it out from here. We have all the necessary measures. As you said, we have been asked about that and we have been asked about it. Because now the world has The way we do it is not only to tell people about something. The world is an organization of the people that will do it to the top of the world. In the past, they had the opportunity to tell a story about the world. We had a world of justice. We had a world of justice only for people. We had a lot of justice for people. We had a society of justice on every street. We had slavery. We had a society of justice. We have a system that can't be trusted by people. Now, look, do you think it's a different thing? Because it's a system that can't be trusted by people. It's a system that can't be trusted by people. The stories of this society is the initial meaning of this society. The days I'm going to teach to anyone, who can't share with others, are going to use a resource to preserve this society. You know, That would be the extent to belleg shortly. We shouldn't be that way, because that would be the extent to the extent to the extent to the extent to the extent that it is vulnerable.
