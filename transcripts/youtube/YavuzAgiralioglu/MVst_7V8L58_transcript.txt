This is the time we are working to get time for our future. We are trying to express our voices that are needed in Turkey at this time. This program will tell us every time that we need to express our voices again and again. We are trying to express our voices that we need to express our voices again and again. We are trying to express our voices again and again. These are our favorite voices today, These are our favorite voices today.

We want to give our voices to the public, We want to buff for the public, We want to play with the public and the public Lane servers that have not finished. Thesekilal unserues address the issues that others need Thank you very much. I don't think it's impossible for you to sleep in the evening. Let me say goodbye to you. I want to say goodbye to you. If you're in the evening, let's start with the rest of the night. In the evening, the night is very close to the evening. This is the time. You know, there were also big competitions in Turkey. We will come to the other competitions. Actually, we talked about you in the day. We talked about some things. We talked about the places and the differences between them. I was curious about this. We talked about it earlier. We spoke about the events in Turkey with Mejist. I was impressed by the fact that I was living in the UK. Mejist, for example, in the middle of the cameras. It's a huge demand. It's a massive demand. When you talk about how you get to a school, you start from the beginning to the end. There's a premium aspect of the market. in order to make people understand each other. As a matter of fact, it comes to a lot more than 100 percent. How do you feel about it? Now, we have a question for you, a company that you are willing to share with us. How will the company be able to talk about the future, how will it be possible for people to understand each other, The problem we have is that we don't talk about the media. We talk about a big thing. For example, a political party is a political party. It is a political party. What is the first thing you have to do? What is the importance of the political party? What is the political party? The political party is the political party. In fact, the situation in Turkey is similar to the situation in the past. The important parameters are the same. You have to make sure that the Commander has pointed out, that the safety of the President, the country is never done in dream… …then they already did this in two aspects. For example, if you make a brother blood case, 약간 your brother in legislator's court, that's it. I think you guys have a problem too. Yes, yes. But again, when you don't say that, We have a problem. Nothing is the most important thing in history. We live like this. We see it in our own way. These are the places we can stay with the citizens. The public has to be protected by the public. And the public has to be protected by the citizens. And the public is protected by the public. The public is protected by the public. And the public has to be protected by the public. And we try to push our fascination toward the public. Especially during the pandemic, that is what the public can do. And the public can do everything they can to help us, to protect the public. We are saying that there is a possibility for the United States. But the United States is the first time in the United States to be a new system, and we see it as a state of emergency. This is the last system. We are going to live like this. The thing we need to talk about in Turkey is that everything is possible in the United States. In the United States, the nature of the United States has come to a large number of countries in the United States. In Turkey, it is said that everything is possible in the United States. If we look at the situation, the United States will be taken from the United States. We are going to continue. Let's think about the situation in the United States. First of all, I would like to congratulate you on this. Of course, we sit here, talk a little, you are talking about it. You are talking about it in a way that is not true to the United States. Many of us are not here. I don't have a lot of questions about the situation or the status of the public, but there is no such thing as a state of emergency. You have a state of emergency, you have a state of emergency, a state of emergency, a state of emergency, there is no such thing as a state of emergency, But I think that in the past, in the past, the world is seen and seen at the same time. The state has seen the country's looks and conditions, so we are coming to bring it and come to a side. Therefore, we will all take this step into account, so let's be a little careful about this. There is a country in the middle, there is a country and this country should be considered as a state. It will be considered as a state that will be considered as a state. What is it? You go to people in the city of Kararveric, you tell your name, or you tell them that the country is considered as a state of the country with a bigger structure. For example, if a country is a country that does not want to destroy the country, it is necessary to destroy the country in such a way that it is a country that does not want to destroy the country. Because in every country we know, it is not like that. If we look at the results of the last four or five years, there are 10 of us who have been wronged. We have our days there. We have a lot of questions about this. We are talking about our information, our information, our information, what do we say about these matters? If we can read the book about this matter with our own needs, then it is in fact the biggest issue in the United States. These matters can be a little easier for us to understand. The second is that there are a lot of questions about the needs of the government, the health and health of the government. people are here, they are just saying about what we did wrong. It is just that they are simply saying it's part of the real situation. It is not nearly true that they are wider than their opinion. They still cannotanting. The talk of the top legal condition that Qulшийcrit the country has. S Uriya tells him what kind of condition relief he rent in Dürk ... If he does not think what kind of microbiology we will write for him after that those decisions will be raised. This is a matter of our country, our country, our nation, our nation. As it comes, we've been in the same place with my father. And our country's most important. But this is the same, it is the same as the country's land. It is the same in the land, in the land of the country, in the land of the people, the land of one, in the land of the enemy, For example, for us, it is the most important thing that we see in the open countries. Is it possible to think about the two sides now? There is no such thing in the context of the idea, but it is said that the AK Parti, from the beginning to the beginning, I think that the government's decision to complete the agreement will be completely under the jurisdiction of the AKP. AKP and the MAP are now in the process. They have come to the MAP for a while to the elections for the first time. They have come to the MAP for a year to the MAP for a alternative agreement. They have come to the MAP for a second time. So, the main goal was to make a mistake and to get the worst out of the country, and they took out another one. Today, they will talk about the opposite. But the opposite is the conflict. If you say the opposite of the conflict, you will tell this to the people. You can give the people the opportunity to get a good deal of it. So, this is the biggest challenge. There is a day, a day, a social media, some people are doing something, they say it's a lie, they say it's a lie. Millipiango is doing something that is not a lie, a question is made, there is a lot of information about it. Now, do you see the faces of a person in the middle of a woman? This is the reason why the people in the country are still fighting against it. This is the biggest problem that we have seen in our country. Why is this situation in Syria today? Because in Syria, there was a conflict with each other, and there was a conflict with each other. We came to the end of the fight. There was a problem in our country. In our country, the biggest problem is that there are many countries in our country. There are many countries in our country. What is the problem? There is a war zone. We have countries like the US and other countries. We can support you in this movement. You can think of one of your own in this movement. But when you are in the new countries, you will be able to make new relations with Allah. You will be able to give a big picture of the country. Thank you. Today, I have a lot of chance to visit Meijista. For example, Yavuz Bey, a general representative of the general government, may be a few. It has been important to see the 2020. Thank you for talking about Meijista. Thank you. They have come to you in different parts of the country. Some things are beautiful. But for example, it is necessary to know about this. Usually, everyone has a beard, a beard and a beard. We are seeing the political situation. In fact, in the middle of the media, in the middle of the media, in the middle of the media, in the middle of the media, in the middle of the media. In my opinion, when we come to Meijista, the passion for improvement is not necessary. We have told our friends about this. First, we had said that... ...we are not coming to Meijista with these concerns. We don't have any concern about either. We are not coming any further. We will say, we will take responsibility... ...we will take responsibility... ...we will take responsibility, we will take responsibility. When you do something that deserves your work, you will not get disappointed. If you want to make this job, don't do it from the bottom of your heart. I mean, we are not foreign people. I wanted to thank the university by the name Nuzdarib. I came to that university by the name of Mavuzudah, as we said earlier, Mavuzudah is a very intelligent university student. He is not famous in the university. This university is under 36 for Mavuzudah. I would like to thank the University of Mavuzudah I told them to come to Kadur from Taşr, and I told them to come here. I told them to come here, my friends, thank you. Today, they will look at it. If you need it, you can do it. They told me to do it. Now, let's say, let's say, let's do it. Let's not forget to eat it. We don't have to worry about it. Let's say, let's do it. They said, let's do it. They said, let's do it, let's do it. I left it there for now, I'm going to ike something I can tell you, as well, because I'm going through it. Thank you very much. Me too, ForAD! Concealing is my story about an event. Yes, Ertan, I'm going to熱 it. I try to film by looking tomode sołbym 고양is works. However, on live broadcasts, There is a process by having a son or another published or working in the propaganda, or working in the media, a few young ladies and gentlemen of the Ministry of Defense showed a complete view from the outside. This is what you think. In our country, in Turkey, unfortunately, there is a complete conflict and there is a huge conflict in a very serious way. Parliament today does not bring their work to the ground, because it is a new government system in Turkey, which is a new government system. It is a new government system which is a new government system, which is a new government system, which is a new government system. There is a dispute with the members of the council in the field of society that has already passed the인 to the people of the EU, among the帝国民, the city of the United States and so on. Plenty of people are in the same climate as the people in the field of society, and there is no doubt that the people of the EU and the nation of the organisation are with themselves, and the leader has completed the same task. Due to its lack of knowledge of many countries, parliament can not hold pressure on the state, and the country is being pushed. In the United States, this is a table which is used in parliament to show their full potential. They are saying that it is impossible to make a choice. That is true. That is why the decision is made to show their potential. But there is a possibility of this increase in the laws to make a choice for the states to be able to make a choice. They have to accept them. They have to accept the same. But the same. They have to accept the same. They have to accept them. They have to accept them. This is a serious issue for the country. The country is trying to continue on this path. In many cases, our country's national economy, parliament, The country's future will come a year. It's not the land on the same scale as the Wheat House. The country's future has been discussed. It has been a big deal, a lot with nuclear power. Can you fly to the other side of this area? Yes. You have also开ed the exchange. Yes, I have already시면ed on that today. Is it the place to talk Russo? I want to speak at ten minutes. I'm not in trouble to take the change in the future. Yes, I'm not. So you are in the middle of the general society. So you are a very powerful man. You know that you are a very powerful man. So, if you are very powerful in the two countries, you are in the middle of the war. In this case, you have to show your power to the people. It is like a powerful man. Because, first of all, you must be careful not to get hurt. Maybe there is a need to get rid of this problem. Yes. Maybe. Maybe it's a need to get rid of Turkey. What will happen to us? We are talking about this. We are talking about this as a democracy. We are talking about this. We are talking about this as a need to get rid of Turkey. Do you think you can get rid of this? First of all, my friends said that here. Do you think we can get rid of this? But there is a good saying in Kemal. I really like it. He said that there is only a rules for different ideas. pillars of discussion. We know our ideas, what do we do and what our circumstances, all politicians, the Queen of goodness, the Queen of honour, the Queen of justice, the Queen of machinery… we do this to all the citizens and leaders in different ideas. I should share with these to reflect there is quench oil and water in area to support specificities. but that all of them will become comfortable for them to use these in front of their arrival. This terrible weather will tighten in the region. There will also be a geos Muayphones or supposedly a watchful dog. It may also be a 내일- municipality to be probability safe because there will be no government leaving the FireCrap in Fahid. This parliament We want to say that this country is a part of the Qur'an. If it's a holiday, then it's a holiday. It's a holiday. But I'll say it's very difficult. It's a very difficult point. Now, we're doing the other part of the program. We're doing it. We want to talk to Beraber here. I think we can talk about this part of the program when we think about the same thing. And when we think about it, or when you think about it, I think that it's a good part of the program. Maybe the MEP and HDP. We can talk about like this. The camera is life is very beautiful. But when the camera comes in front of you, it changes immediately. Now we have a conflict with these papers. Both of us have to have papers on it. And the agreement has been made. The agreement has been made by the political parties. We must be careful! Everybody is taking care of the past. I would give you the first one. In 2009 and 2004, the Cumur-Yatalk Parties of Istanbul, in the 5th century, in Belediye, took over 100 to 25 dollars in that area. After that, in the last period, you can see the Cumur-Yatalk Parties in Turkey. In the 70-75 dollars in that area. The Cumur-Yatalk Parties of Istanbul. The same way. If you ask the children in 5 years, in front of Ankara, there is a place in the 30s, whose children will hang on the battlefield and his children will hang on the battlefield, the Cumur-Yatalk parties will hang on the battlefield. In the same way, his son-in-law will hang on the battlefield, because it's the right way. It was the right way. But this happened in the trip to Turkey at the end of this year. This was happening. Yes, it is impossible for people to believe it. It's normal to say that it's the end of the story, it's the end of the story. There are thoughts. There are lies, there are antilayks. There are otteries, there are democracy. There is always something like that. There is a lot of work to be done. You have a very nice note. When you were in the past, there was a program in the last few years. It was the opportunity to listen to it in the program. We said that we wanted to ask a question in Syria. We were in the beginning. We asked the question why we didn't solve it. And I'm telling you. Because we didn't find the answer. This is very important. When we came to find the answer, we didn't understand the state that we could talk about. Today, in Turkey, we have a question like that. Exactly. Let's continue. Why? Because there is a part of a part of your story. But there is no such a part. There is one person. As I said before. There is someone else. There is Tayyip Erdoğan. They say that they can come here and talk. No. They are the same. Because they all say Tayyip. They say that they are not part of the story. They say that they are different. They are different. Yes. They say that they are different. Yes. Look. I caught a little. I caught a lot of things, sir. I caught it. It is a problem and this is Turkey. In a bad way. Now, the information I received is very useful. I believe that it was useful. And it is a bit tough. Because if you put it that way, you can see the first person's position. In Turkey, It's the first generation to meet the first generation of the Sports Festival. The rally has already been established in the?!? And our favourite public sector has now had the first generation. The Turkish Association. The Turkish National Assembly and the Turkish Media Board. The Turkish National Bank and the National Security Office. We are the first-generation International Police Forces, now 6 years old, we have a total shortage of them, this attitude of the people, the government, the government of their own, the government of their own. The implementation of this is a great challenge for you to achieve your goals, and this is the reality of this organization. Now, this is our first step. The foundation of this organization is a foundation for a society that is very important. Generally, political communication, government communication, government communication, government communication, discussion, government communication, decision-making, government communication, all kinds of policies that everything can be made up for the political. Why are we doing this? Because all kinds of policies are forbidden for the politicalää. That is, you can only apply the system to the political automatically. I mean, I want to make sure that all the energy and energy that I have in my mind are in my mind. I mean, you can be a liar, but if you want to be a liar, I have something in my mind that I have in my mind that I have in my mind that I have in my mind. and the people who have not been informed of the situation, have been informed of the lack of confidence in the career, the politics of the country, is not a concern of the politics, but a concern of the people who are not informed of the politics. Now this is a typical democracy, the monarchy, the oligarch, the turning back and the mechanism. The political center of the world is still in the way, so the political center is in crisis. Turkey has always been the leader of the Turkish government, and has always been the barrier of the Turkish government. So, Turkey has actually turned the entire world into a new mechanism for the Turkish society, and has turned the entire world into a new mechanism for the Turkish society. Now, how does this country have to deal with the crisis? It's not the right choice. For example, in the 16-year-old Arabian countries, they said that they would not be able to say the word of every word of the word. In 2002, in the first half of the year, the government, the government, the government of all alternatifis, left their own advantage to become the president of the United Nations. In the 16th century, in addition to the fact that they have returned to the United Nations, it is still a part of the most important part of this society. So for example, what is the market number? In the case of this year, the CIS-Cas pal has not reached the limit. For example, the CIS isjungle from the top of the head, from the upper of the CIS. And also from the upper of the head. For example, the SIR PASE isjungle from the bottom of the head. From the top of the CIS. But Kusur is currently the SIR PASE. We don't know about the situation of the military. How? Let's go from the perspective of the military. That's right. Sometimes it's not enough to tell the authorities not to come. You can say that you can tell the authorities to come to the police. But it's not enough to tell the authorities. We're telling the police. The state of the military is also aware that the state of the military is trying to solve the problem. I try to draw impressions. One of our most difficult things, we have to do this, not to add pressure, not to make your expectations. I would like to express my gratitude to you, God willing, for all of us. I am grateful for you. I cannot say anything. We don't even have a chance to say that all of our sources are better than the real ones. That's all I have to say. The reason why we are talking about our sources is the fact that we don't know many more sources than the exact ones. For example, when we listen to the prayer and pray in prayer, we have to do what we can and what we can do and what we can do. They are right, but the prayer is not done. So, the prayer is accepted by Mary. Now, these Christians are whether they are afraid or not, or they are afraid to lie down or check. Are you aware of the things that they don't have to do when they are afraid to bring them back to the world? They say, we are doing this to the other people. How do we get 40, 50 percent? Now, we cannot be the president of the UN, we cannot do the president of the UN. In fact, the president of the president, as the government says, is doing this to the people of the region. When did he first say that he is a lawyer? If we say that we can change the selection of Davranish, it is said that it is used at the time. It is said that there is a difference between these values. And this difference, if we know that it is a very high-quality place, then it is not possible to use it there. Is it possible to use it there? It is normal. It is a 3.610 point of view. It is something that comes out of the benzer. The selection of Davranish in the selection of Davranish is always taken care of. So, for the sake of your general selection, we will tell you new options for the new selection. First of all, we will tell you the number of changes in the selection of Davranish in the selection of Davranish in the selection of Davranish. We will take the first step of the selection of Davranish or the second part of the selection. I actually want to use it in the selection of Davranish. I would like to talk about this, but I don't want to talk about this, but I would like to talk about this, how are you doing? How are they doing this? How are they doing this? They are not doing this. People are doing very well. And they are vying for you. And people who don't understand it will not understand it. I don't know about your opinions, but these are things that you cannot tell. There is an Ayrfan here. There is an Ayrfan here, but these people are as if fake or fake as Yavuz Bey. You're right, you're right, brother, what will happen? What will you do? You have a man like Ersaniz, he said that he'll do the Shahat. I will give 20 for 10 months. I will give a little money. I will give you money. You can't go anywhere. This man can't do this. So, to get the top, to get the top, to get the top, to get the top. The other part is that we have to talk about the development of the situation. There is also a problem in this. We, that is, the people of this country, that is, the development of the situation, the development of the situation, the development of the situation, if they say so, we are an amazing society. We know that we have the hope that we will give everything we have in this world. We believe in this. This will be it. Now, from this point of view, the development of the situation, the problem is that, this man can't do this. So, one, in the case of you, you have to find a solution to this problem. One, two, there is a problem in this matter. Think like this. We need to turn this into a situation for the leaders to turn into a situation. I have to turn this into a situation for the leaders to do the same. For the leaders to do the same, I tell both people the right side for this, I tell them, you are the most beautiful lady. Now, if you can take this step, then I can take this step back. No, it's okay. You have to take this step back. So, it's important to take that step back. to take this step back. Because Cheering was one of the most important things. And this is one of the biggestよろしくvenly important thing. Let's talk about this. We are the idealist. And we are the source of our religion. Syrians, warrants, war buses, war buses, war buses, war buses, war buses. If we had to enter the city, there was something that we wanted to do. We had to use this method. We used to use this method before. So for our country today, we used to use this method again. So we used to make it more natural. So let me just move out from here on. This trend of image-oriented image live here. I believe that all of this is up to the point. For example, I believe that this country has a very powerful population. I don't know what that means. But this country is working hard to achieve this. Do you believe in this? I mean, there is no such thing as a big city in Konya. Do you live in Konya? So, you are living in this world? No, you live in this world. There are over 3-4 universities, and these universities there are in the big picture. As I mentioned, I am actually representing them in the big games too. This is where I am telling you, that no one in this world is able to get to the reality with someone who is already going to the real world. This technology is so good and it gives you a strong sense of purpose. This is what it is meant to see. It gives you a strong sense of purpose. This is what the saying is. You live in the same way. There is a referendum. Yes, yes, who is the MP? Who is the MP? The MP is the MP. The MP is the Democrat Party. You are a dog. Why are you standing like a dog? I will go like an animal. You are going to the wrong way? There are conditions. There is a dog in the corner. If we go to the corner alone, we must have something. If you go, they cannot meet and the dog is not coming. They are not coming. The Second Convention. The Second Convention in the corner. When they entered, they read things. Two channels were written on these programs. I don't know how they were written on it. It's a channel. You have 50 channels. You can say something to Ali. If you have any questions, go to your brother Ali. But this... You have to know that. It's not a single one. You have to see it in your own way. They didn't say that it was impossible. It was only a single one. You can say that. Let's talk about it. The things, the mistakes, the fear, the knowledge. It's just a single one. But it's not the best. You need to know that. Erdal, actually you said that you have a lot of talent. You have a lot of talent. But I think it's a little bigger than this one. If you look at it, I have a lot of strength. But it's a very good one. Everyone has it. I'm a guest. I see the mistakes in the past. The mistakes are not just mistakes. It's a very good video. They ask you about it. What do you say? They ask you about it. It's a very good statement. That's why we are afraid of not being able to do anything. I like it. What do you think? We will come from our eyes. It is an important position of our own. So do you think it's a uniform? Did you think it's a uniform? If it's an治, then where is it? How will you set the democracy? How can you set the democracy anywhere in Russia? There is no democracy on China. You must wait for the fear of it. Every part of the society is scared of it. You see when I saw you, you see who was it? I didn't get the parliamento. I have been in a different situation, but I don't know how the situation would be. We have to go to the other side. Now he has been doing a painting of a painting in the Mejiz Kursus. He has been doing a painting of a painting of a painting of a painting of a painting of a painting of a painting. Where did the painters see the more they were? You have seen? Have you heard of it until today? You don't have to say that we're not an independent government, we're not talking about any differences among the disagreeative parties. But if you think that right, it's going to be a difficult and a punishment, in the case of war, for instance, we're not down to a solution, we're not going to talk about that at all. But if we follow the🤔 step-by-step rule and we might be punished first, we'll be punished right away. We're starting now. Now, the government, these are the rise-to-state rise. In front of the State Council, there is no government in Turkey. The government forces force force force force force. All these military forces force force force force force force. In Kursu, there is a parliament, a political party, a group of other people. The ideas of the Aykara have been destroyed. It has not been destroyed. It has been destroyed. The women who were not young were not given a chance. Have they ever stayed up and down? Where can the people speak or speak? How can we talk about the democracy of these nations? There is no fear in Turkey. All these of them are under attack. Look, we are between 72 years after the referendum in Turkey with the system coming. What was she saying about the party today? in the difficult times, as a matter of the Militia Party in order to extort the Militia party, I have a question about what they said in the middle of this. Is it nothing more than the nullification of the Militia government in Turkey? They are not saying that they are talking about each time. The government said that the Militia Party was nullification. Today, with the names of the Dumaors of different states and their constitution, Is there a difference in the number of people who have found themselves in the country? The same thing. In the same way, in the same time, in the same time, in the same time, in the same time, in the same time, in the same time, in the same time. What part of the party has? The other side is talking. Today, we haven't understood your part's value and where it belongs. An important thing. Everything! You'll have your own opinion. Now, you're starting to think based on your past thoughts. We are now thinking of meeting the meaty people of this country. While the road is on the top of it, there are many things we need to think about. When the time comes, the attitude of the people is very high. When something goes wrong is what happens. If you don't have a channel, we'll talk about it in the next video. If you find this video useful, we'll continue. We'll see you in the next video. But first of all, we can come to a person who is a member of the government. I will take the opportunity to give this letter to the government. We will see a lot more often. We call it a coalition. The coalition in general is a parallel universe of parliament. Of course. So, after the election of the two parties, it will come to an end. And it is a coalition in order to save a lot of power. So, what is the biggest coalition in the world? Yes. But now... We see that there is nothing in the world. There is a coalition in general. What will you say? There is nothing in general. Yes. So, what did the government say about us? They said that Turkey left the coalition in the future. Right? They said that the government will save a lot of power in the United States. Everyone said that. They said that the coalition is a parallel universe. We call it a parallel universe of parliament. In general, the coalition is not firm. It is living as a river. The first party, for example, is getting members. It is not getting members. So, just the farmers' opposition. Or the government's orders is reduced there. You give that place a lot of help. We see the situation in Turkey. But, I am so lucky. If you can remember that it is a lot more than a day or two. In fact, this situation is a little bit difficult for you to choose in a way that you don't know. I give it a try. I'm coming to a point. My brother, we have a great power. We can say it for you. But in the end, for him to come to a point, I think this is the problem that I know. This is what I want to tell you. It can be done in the end of the game. Let me tell you something. I'm in the position of the enemy. This is how it works. Today, if you ask your son as a child, if he takes care of the TV, Who is that TV? What is it? Have you ever heard of that? Turkey has such a difficult relationship. Turkey has a lot of money to play. If I say it in the game, I mean, we don't have any money to play. We don't pay attention to it. I am not a candidate for the party. We are talking about our opposition. A lady is in the middle of a Darbe. But what did we do? We changed the situation. I told the women who came to our job. We don't know what the problem is. But we are not a candidate who is a head of the party. We will think about it as a democratic party, since we are in the middle of the military. Because it is a good idea, 16 years later, it is a good time. Turkey's inflation has increased. It has increased the losses. It has increased the loss of money. There is a lack of money, there is a lack of energy in our society. The dollar is not the same as Turkey's economic situation in other countries. It is not the opposite situation. The situation is not good, it is good when it comes to the news. We were talking about the inflow to the mother. There is a war in the U.S. As a mother of the United States, it was divided into two parts. They are very weak and weak. In other countries, the war was very weak. And there are some examples of democratic issues that we have made in the past. When I talk about the political situation, I think it's not a compromise. Look, Turkey has made a choice for the 30th century. This is the case of the Cumuriyat. The Cumuriyat was founded by the Cumuriyat, and there are many different options for the 30th century. There are various options for this. And there are certain options for the Anayas. There is a very large democracy party in Paris, which is a very important part of the democracy party. In the past, there were no elections in Ankara. There were no elections in this country. There were no elections in Trafoy. There were no elections in Paris. There were no elections in 2016, but in 2014, there were no elections in 2011. Yes, it is a little more. Now, is there a party in Turkey, which is only here? There is a party in Turkey, which is a party in Turkey. There is no party in Turkey. There are no elections in 30z1. There is no election in 30z1. There are no elections in 30z1. On top, there were no elections in 3z1. There were no elections in a political party or any political party or any political party. But including, the online shows, 500 million yen, which caused 500 kinds of rupees costs, which were about 500 million yen, which caused the government to run the Lesson. We, both, all of us, are helping the Democratic Party and the Party of the Capernaum and the AK. We are helping the old party with the words that we've received with the government, we are helping the C-Spartners. I'm saying I'll take 500 million of the first parts of them, I would like to say that I know about the results of the National Party's election. But the Constitution is a little bit more than it is. Let's ask. I want a little bit of advice. We are taking a short break from here, and in the same way, in Turkey, in 1898, we have to show our allies and choose to work together. Where are the allies? We are part of the United States, we are part of the United States, I don't want to be part of the United States, I'm the United States, I'm the United States, we are the United States. We are part of the United States, I talk about the democratization of Turkey. We will discuss the freedom of democracy, the freedom of democracy of the United States, the freedom of democracy of the United States. And that is the reason of the crisis. We are in the right direction. Our contract waiting for a president, the president of our state, the president of the state is just over 50 percent. We have never been to Mass or do that. We have bought this and it has stopped. OK. We can't운 this. This is not agreement. It's not this case. That's not the case. It is a kind of a lie. This is not a lie. If you are not an agent, ask the right river people. I don't know if it will be an agent from this. Can you say the right-wing one for the right river? Let's continue to say a little bit. Of course, a little more, a little more, a little more. But we have a different problem. But also, i have one minute to think. It has become more and more complex. But we have to talk about the solution. We have to talk about the solution in the end. But there are things that we need to talk about. The only thing we need to talk about is the solution we need to talk about. This is also good. But the people are thinking about what we need to talk about when we go to the market and go to the market. Now, we are in the basement. There are friends here, the cameras are in the back. There is a camera with a camera in the back. If you come, if you have a stick on your hand, Thank you, you are welcome. You are back. What are you doing? You are back. Then, the old man, the old man, I took a photo with him. If he was dead, everything would be over. One of those girls went to the hospital. He went to the hospital. He is back. For example, when we get this stick, we get it with the rest of it. But again, it is a new part of it. This is where the old man starts. For example, this is the case. It is a part of the city, If it is a part of the city, we get a problem with the public economy. If the insurance companies accept it, what are the problems? It was the case with the old man. we are living in politics in so much, too. We still don't want to go back to Syria and中共 to Turkey and Turkey. In fact, there are those consequences. Let's see if it's safe. It is not known for ever. It's not the same thing, but one thing is that one thing, be careful. We don't know about the Tokyo military, one thing we call a hurricane. It will think about it, like a circle of violence. But this country has a lot of problems, it doesn't answer them. There is something that people are not interested in. All of these are in the same position. We are in a position where we are in the right position. We are in the right position, the democratic position, the democratic position. We are in the right position where we are in the right position. If we were to be able to get it, we would not have been able to get it. We are talking about our issues. We have two things to deal with. It's a game. I would like to address the question in detail about the opening of the network. It's a very difficult task. We have to be careful and try to avoid keeping the system in touch. We have to be careful. It's fine. But we must understand that we have to work hard and find chances. There is also an open dialogue gap with one of my colleagues. This is the first thing that happens here. I mean, if you put it in the middle of the night, it would be dangerous. It would be dangerous. So this is something... In other words, there are more and more important things in Arzuet. This is the way it is. We need to be aware of it. It is the most important thing to be aware of. We are saying all these kinds of words. Does what part of composition or composition you talk about? How about talking about certain parts together? We have no particular range for our body, body and body. Of course we want to discuss about certain parts. It is up to us that we want to change their body and move on. We want to move on. We can do that, we have a彈法. I understand this, but what happened to me? How can I say that I am talking about what happened to my brother-in-law? This is the reason why I have to look at this situation. I don't know, I don't know what is the reason why I have to look at this situation. I don't know why I have to look at this situation. The reason why I have to look at this situation. Today, we are trying to maintain the same problem. We are trying to ensure that the country has the right to be able to make the same decisions. We are also opening this issue in this issue, and we are seeing a process as a result. There is no news about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Now, we have two members of the Democratic Party's general government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We had the opposition with the Prime Minister of the President. Now, all of these have been heard by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We have also been in the country. Fırsat, Yarın, şu anki akpartialindeki bütün bu belediye bir sahir vesaire imkanları, bunların 1810 belediyelerinden gittiğinde bu onların kafasına dank edecek. Yav ne oluyor dedirtecek. Yalnız tam vazgeçelim diyecek. Çünkü akpartinin vesaire'in cümin başkanının kendince en temel meşüyet kayna oy oy almak. Biraz önce bir şey yok mu? Now, the biggest thing is this, because Yavuz Bey was very good at it. He gives such a feeling to his feelings. Brother, now I'm doing the same thing. I'm taking the task. If I take the task, I can continue to do it. I mean, I continue to do this. I don't see it, but I see it. I'm doing the same thing, but I see the task. Brother, now I can continue to do it. Now, when we have the information, this is the same thing. Brother, this is the same thing. I don't see it. You give me the task. I can actually say that it's not my father's fault. When we look at the socialization, we see that it's a different way. The AK Party is a very interesting game. It's a game that's a lot of fun. The AK Army is a game that's a lot of fun. The AK Army is a game with a lot of fun. If I decide to go on a strike, the AK Army is the same thing. If I decide to go on a strike, I don't know whether I should go on a strike or not. Because the AK Army is a game that's a lot of fun. We say that we're a part of the AK Army. Disappearingly We have already met the KD party when we were a Certainly cooperation. Every party has the same view as the event present. Our government has the same view as the event present. We actually have to win a prize. We've been doing all this for a long time. We haven't told anyone about what's happening. We don't know what's happening. You've been doing something like that for a long time. I've told you a few things. We said that we came to this area for a reason. We are talking about this. We used to use this to the extent that the media power in AKP are not enough. People were in AKP when they were in AKP, they had to come and get us to the alternative level. Let us give AKP to the media. We gave the media to the media. Now, this is going to happen. Normally, in the last couple of years, and the previous situation in the region, we will have a clear and calm situation. Let's go to Konya. They have been at the top in the past, what is about to happen right now? Look at the situation outside of Belediye, why the situation in Belediye is behind such a situation? This may be a matter of time after this, you may have not been able to get one of them in the past. This will be a place where we will be lost, where we will be lost. The reason is to be lost, there is fear, there is the end, this mystery, In this way, we need to see the situation in front of us in such a situation. In fact, we will be able to say that this situation will take place in the future. Every part of this situation will be a alternative to the country. We, if we come from the parts of the world, I would like to give you an important example of what we have been trying to achieve in the past. As I said before, I would like to talk about the traffic police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police. First of all, I thought it would be a great opportunity to be like this. After a few days, I thought to myself that some of the people will be able to get their own way or get their own way. Turkey has such an important thing as well. It has become a very important thing to be able to get their own way. If there is something you want me to tell you, let me know. I mean, if we lose that position, we will not accept the fact that we are going to accept it. Of course, if you are going to accept it, it will be another thing. Yes, yes. Our problem is that we believe that we will be able to make a decision about the situation in Turkey. Therefore, we should not accept the fear of the situation. We should be afraid of the situation. We are very lucky but when we consider it with our capabilities we actually need to have our capabilities with the right direction. We think that this is a bad strategy. Of course we don't think we can do a bad strategy. we have promised to hold an opportunity to meeting our goals. Instead of reminding everyone to be productive, consider themselves. But then our former goal is to always help each company and work made with their own effort to work on them. All they all do is to be happy. This is what we expect both sides, both set our ranks, both sides in which We have tried to sell the 23-kcal taxes, the 23-kcal taxes were sold on the second day, and we did it. At the end of 2016, we had to sell the 23-kcal taxes and we were only able to sell the same taxes. We only did what we did. We did it as much as we were able to sell the taxes. The last one was the last one. And the last one was the 117-kcal taxes, we did the same thing with the SQP, we paid the money, and we paid the bills. $ 60.2 million. The prices of the price for the 802 million. The price of the price of the price for the price of the price for the 2.5 million. That is, the price of the price for the money. So, we have the right to buy this. And this is actually the ultimate thing. We are at our expense with the board, our money is with the board, we are going to give you the information that we are going to make. We have been comfortable with this. Now, we have come to the time of the board. Because the boards are going to make you, we are going to make you the money by the way of the money. We call it a worldly situation. We can't call it a worldly situation for 16 years, and we'll also ask you, for your financial attention. Your family, your friends, your family, and your family, are in a different world. But for this, they're just as far away as possible. We're thinking about our guest, the city of Maharet, and the political center of the country. It's a very dangerous situation. It's a situation. I don't know how much this country will be in this country. And what the government is saying is that we are the most difficult situation. The most difficult situation is that we are the most difficult situation. So, we are talking about the situation in the state and the country. Our country is our country. At the beginning of the war, we want to have an opportunity to fight with a strong force and to fight against the power of our enemies, and we will be the best in our country. Of course, our country is a country of power. The dollar that we have, we can make the money we have. We can use all our medias to solve the problems we have on our hands. We can use it to build a strong force in the place we have been in. You are doing it. You are only doing it with your idealism, with your knowledge, with your knowledge, with your love, but you can't say it. You can't say it. You can't say it. You can't say it. You can't say it. This is how it is. Every time, it is the closest place to the end of the universe, it is a new universe. It is possible. Therefore, I am in this part of the game. For example, in this game of AK Parti, in this game of CERBEZELHALIN, in this game of CERBEZELHALIN, I see a place like this in Beraber. I am controlling this. You are also watching it. We are our part in this game of AK Parti. That is what we need to think about this AK Parti. With ourыпers to explain this. Yes. With MUNYA, the game of polynomials. Yes. In fact, we nurture the game of 100 percent of it. The game also gives us the opportunity to put aside our male impact power. May our AK Parti players love our country man. Bring us creativity. I think that we should find a real country where it is not a political place. I think that it is a democratic country. It is a kind of a country where you can't come to a single place, for example, we have to build a whole country where we can create a whole country. However, when the people in the country are in the same country, I see the country's support for Turkey's leadership. There is a secret between the two countries that are now in Taiwan. In 2002, I gathered all the political leaders in Turkey. I was the leader of the political forces of my country, Sağ'ın, Herşubesi, Solun, Makul Şubeleri, Liberals, and so on. I was a member of this group, and this was a member of this group. All the political leaders in Turkey gathered all the political leaders in Makul. Now, as you all know, When they put their heads to the political parties, they put their heads to the political parties. Therefore, we have a limit to the government. We have a limit to the government. The government is making this decision today. If we don't see the limit, we will not be able to see it. Of course, we will be doing it with the political parties. I think the biggest economic crisis in the world is the economy. We have to not forget about it. It is a very young, very young, very young, very young, very young. If we can go and walk straight down, we'll have to walk the streets. We can get a political opportunity, and we can get a political opportunity. Is that so? How? Are you thinking about being positive? No, I'm thinking like this. This is a matter of fact. Our fathers, our fathers, our fathers, our fathers, their fathers, all of them, their people, their neighbours, their families. They have to eat them. They have a way to get them. Then they can have a meeting. This country was built. This week, the headquarters of our headquarters is a big part of the company. The current year of the elections has been a young and young person. The truth is that the election of the United States and its investors will remain a secret for all of the candidates and themidwives of the United States. We all feel a sense of our country is on the rise by going ahead with the powers of the United States. The explanation for our country. It is not my reason, it's not a place for my career, age, fun, It is a farmership, a company that can help bring my passion to a society to a society that's the right to live in. The capital is very difficult. It's a dynamic society. It's a healthy society, it's a collective society to allow them to fully serve the society. It's a democratic mentality, this is a system that can stop the people. We will not hear what is going on from Malash, but he will tell a story about the idea of the Russian Republic of China. The idea is what we're talking about. Yes, the idea is what the state says. It's just that far away from this. The idea is that the idea will be passed on to the East, the East, the West, the West. The idea is that the idea will be passed on to the East, the West, the East, the West, the West, the West, the West, the West. A very positive idea of the idea is that the idea will be passed on to the East. We're learning that a little bit. We are learning a lot now that the state is in danger, that is, the political nepotism. So, in Turkey, we are living in a barbaric world that does not have any turning back. So, we are living in a barbaric world where the people of me and the people of the world are in danger. So, in the time of this, all the details we have, we will know. Maybe they don't know now, but they will know. The most difficult thing for us, our last highlights, is the nature of our own nature, our lost, and lost in our own lives. Now, the state's goals are to prevent any delay on its own goals and not allow any delay to replace its health. We want to stop it from falling, Huzam. Because we want more of this. I believe that this country, in the future, will be the same as the country's economy, the country's economy, the economy, and the society. The right way was that way. I believe the bad thing about it. I believe that it will be the same as the idea of the situation, but the way the situation will be the same. I believe that it will be the same as the situation in the future. From the start, I will be talking to the members, and I will be telling the members what is going to end. Today, my friends, I believe that you will support them for 5-6 years before you're done. So today, our friend, Tayt Bey, has done 8-10 years before you're done. You will be doing it after 8-10 years. ...that they would have to pay for it. Therefore, the government has always accepted this Turkish-speaking President's invitation to the President's office. He said that he would never leave the country in the same place as he was. The Turkish government will see the future of the state and the state's military. The state's military will never leave the country. So, once the government is in the same state, the state will be in the same state. Once we are in the same state, the state will be in the same state. The President is a citizen. He's met with his friends and friends, Kadro. To see his family's family, he went out to see his family. When he returned from his own generation, he had to do better things with a Turkish passport. He took his family and his family. He did what he wanted to do. We don't think of him now. He's our relative. We're our relative, our relative. Our family is now in front of the family. He's a relative, a relative, a relative, a relative. He's a relative, a relative, a relative. But I'm finishing it like this. He's like a relative to the Turkish passport. He's a relative. He's not as close to the passport that he's sent. Now, we start to separate our new passport. We want our relative to our new passport. But since we're a relative, and we are now making sure that our enemies are not going to destroy us. Our aim is that we cannot protect our enemies and not to hide our enemies. Because we are not going to be a problem for our enemies, we are in a big trouble with a control, and that's why we are saying this. We are a problem that has become a part of our constitution. We need to protect our enemies more carefully and make sure that we can protect our enemies and we can make sure that we can protect their enemies. We are going to give you the last words that we are going to give you a little more energy and we will give you the opportunity. We are living in a situation where we have started to get rid of the issue and started to get rid of the issue. For example, we have to get rid of the issue before we get rid of the issue. Because the government will see the result of this issue. The political parties will also see the result of this issue. We see a lot of important things in all of these areas, we see a lot of importance. From our part, we put a piece of work in a way that is very serious. When we said that, we said that in the early 1980s, 5 Belediyas were held in Turkey in general. In the late 90s, there were no Belediyas in Istanbul. In the late 90s, we were told that Belediyas were held in Turkey. Belediyas were told that Belediyas were held in Turkey. We also see this light in the air. We think that we will give an example of a similar light to the light of the light of the light. In our part of the topic, we see that we have a set of賽 and experience of their tocces. So, we see this color as a flashback, as a flashback. As I told you a bit ago, I'm also in this space, there is a sign of the night sky blue, this is the night sky blue sky blue. In the general velsecret sky blue, these men are very close to the sky blue, they are very close to the sky blue. He was a member of the Eiffan University of sealant of the state's working and leadership. In 1813, when he was successful, he said he would go to the 10-year-old. He was not going to the 10-year-old and in 2002, he was in the upper part of the business. He had seen the situation in the military and the fire of the government. In 2007, he also had the funds to know that the construction was in his favor. I was in the military service of the FETO, and I was in the military service of the military. I have to say something to Ergen Okun, because I was not a civilian officer. Today, I am in the military service, I am in the military service of a group of soldiers who are currently operating in the army. That's why, for example, we need to see it differently. For 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, human life is very much. But in a country of a mill, it is not very time-consuming. They all come together. We see these elections very closely from each other. In our mill, I don't know what to do with this topic, I don't know what to do. I want to give a answer to this topic. In the end, I don't know what to do with this topic. I want to make a decision. We don't look at the matter like this. We have to make a program in Turkey. We have to do something that is lost in Turkey. There are many poor critical issues in Turkey, but more important, as Bakar He was saying, we can't build that problem for those disabled disabled people. We have to build such a chaos for them because all these jobs are in debt. In these poor countries, we want to build an independent environment to have nice employees. We have a different friend who says that when there is a war in the village, if there is a war in the village, we will continue to fight against the enemy. First of all, let's stop the war from the side. Now, in Turkey, there is a political situation. So, this is the current situation. So, there is no problem with the situation. But there is such a side. I don't see a lot of countries like this. They say that they are going to go like this. So, there is a problem with the situation. There is a problem with the state. But we are trying to go against them. The state's security issues are also connected with the state. They are also connected with the state that is not shared with government. The state is aware of security issues. In order to strengthen the government, there will be a problem with security issues. Those who can establish the official security issues, they will have a strong conversation with them. No. The only person in the world is Elyan. It's not a program for Ertan. There's a little bit of a discussion about the second episode, but the first episode of the second episode is completely finished. Yes, the logic is missing, you know, it's not impossible. It's not possible. There is a question in the fact that the government of this country is not talking about the reality in the economy right now. There is no question that it's a question in the sense of being honest. Let's say that there are some questions. One, we have a question about the Basque in Turkey. There is a question about the religious politics. What is the horizon of this relationship? There is a relationship between the other parties in Turkey. We all have to take this from the middle, because it is hard to take this from the middle. It is not difficult for any country. In Turkey, there is a possibility that the EU and the democratic countries will be able to unite our nation with this. Turkey is not a partying country. There is no such a country like Turkey. There is a possibility that the democracy that the elections are made, that is, there is a possibility that the citizens will be able to move forward with that. Do I have 40 votes or 40 votes? This is what our citizens have done in the past. There is a problem with the citizens. The state of the economy is controlling the state of Turkey. The state of the state of the state of the country is doing this. This is what the state of the state is doing. We are talking about this. Now, in Turkey, the situation is very bad. The situation is not as bad as the situation is in the past. We want the state for everyone. We want our brothers to win. We want theonz to win. Pazim Mustafa Kemal Atletürk Turgut. Pazetikur and not. Pazet Mohammad Mustafa! He protects all of us, we do what we need. Now, how do you use this mission, how are you going to use it? You are not the one who I am like that. In a way, there is a state formation here, a building, and a forestry and a local area. So, they chose forestry and forestry. I used to say I was致 ichthy I said in the last one, I went to another elections in an old-fashioned way. They only praised Yauz Bey. I don't even say it in the language, I mean, I don't say it in the language of taking care of the planet. But it is the first priority. It isn't the last time, it is still the last time, yes. It is the last time that it is the last time that it is the last time, Macron then общates with the official verify everyone else. We're richer than we do now, our ideas share our resources. Our ideas are able to form up our possibility, as long as it's the starting point. He knows you're the one to tell my response. Stampin מת between us, we are sharing a language that we do the same. We are a 30-year-old man in the area of the world. We are all in the area of the 1998 world. We are fighting against ourselves in our own areas. We are fighting against ourselves in our own ways, and our own ideas, our own thoughts, our own thoughts. We are the ones who are so proud of their existence. We are a very talented, healthy, passionate, mission, we are in a very different direction and the Interest of the Eritish War. Since we were a part of the economy, I thank you very much for your support. I pray for your friendship with the rest of Turkey. May you have an successful land in the future. Thanks again for your time.
