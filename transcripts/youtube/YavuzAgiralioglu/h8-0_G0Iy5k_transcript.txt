. When we think about this matter, we will have an opportunity to review twenty-one-three of our guest guests, because we hope that the two guests who are willing will be able to share more good news about this government. We hope that we can share a lot of our ideas with the Party and our people and the company. You have the last thing which I want to talk about in지가, oung, and beside, public tester. The second thing which I really want to talk about is the second thing which I want to talk about, it's good for religious diversity on the way, ooh,hahahings and other stuff on ourlists, but then there is also a very small issue about civil events behind our political projects, and people keep saying things to them. They are really thinking about it. Everyone is talking about it like this. Everyone is talking about the same, but they are saying that they are not listening to it. Do you have any questions about it? What is it about? The citizens have come from far away. When they came to the table to open the table for the leaders of the parliament, the voices of the citizens, the party, the government and the politicians, We are doing this from the bottom of the sea. If we are able to find a better place for the Parliamentary Millet, we can find a place where we can stay. But I don't want to say it bad for everyone, but we want to make a decision to make a decision about the leaders. And the government is not able to make a clear decision as it is a matter of time. I am talking about the death of the Males of Males. The democratic death of the Males was actually a violation of the democracy. I am talking about the death of the democratic death of the Males. I am talking about the death of the Males of Males. This is what we have been talking about. Do you have any advice? In fact, it is a very difficult decision to make a political party, to make a very serious decision, to make a decision. And it is a very important decision to make a very important decision to make a very important decision. They live in their lives, and this parliament is still in progress. It is not just the current situation. It is not the end of the election of the 20th century, it is still in the past 10-2011 parliament. However, as far as they are concerned, parliament is still in progress. It is not just the current situation. The parliament has to rely on it. There is a completely closed system in it. This is the problem. The parliament has been dissatisfied with the elections in the 2020 elections. They say that they will give their own way to the military. They will not be able to be able to be able to be destroyed by the government. Of course, they did it in the first part of the change in the mother's house. But after the fourth year, parliament was held. The parliament was not ready, but it was held in a few minutes. There are some technical issues that come from parliament. But they are not ready to be defeated by the end of the year. There are no specific tasks that come from the government, but the government does not come from the government. It is not. There are many things that are common in the world. For example, there are things that come from us. They do not come to take the days. For example, there are the living rooms. So, or... The most common things are... There are things that are not available to people. There is no way out. I said it for two weeks before the first one. There are many things. So, there are words that are different from the other. Yes, yes. Parliament or all the top. There is a saying that we will do this. All the events in the region, including the events, were in the process of the development. We had a different technology. We had this in the past. They didn't say anything about it. They said, it's the right thing. You have to think about what will happen. If you have a problem with your own programs, the door is closed, they also lock down on the door, and we can see how the other side of the door will be. The door will be closed because they always have an understanding of how the door will be closed. I'm curious, there is nothing but an opinion. You can't tell what the point should be if you don't get a new point. If you don't write the word, for instance, that we make the same, that pretext. That pretextes, that period. As the servant of my bad uncle and creator did, the master of his judgment was confident. He was a good source of trust. He came back to the last year, but he didn't say anything. He wrote it as a punishment. He doesn't write it like this. He says, may I not interfere in anything but the master of the last year. He said that he will do his best. Because of the situation Fahgot war has no solenoid reaction, but casts lecture is irrelevant. The journalists are not confident in the current situation. Now the sources are allituated to the society — this system, the violence of nature is a systemic relative. Head to their own argued into the situation. Well, now, everything has turned into a relation of absolute pointless. Of course, it is possible that we are trying to implement the parliament in the future. But the system itself is not a system for parliament. This is a good example from the 6th century, but it was said that it was a good example. In the end, there was a lot of parliament, so some people came to the parliament and asked for the freedom of the people. We are talking about the freedom of the people. Yes, how can they say that? We are asking them. My friends, I don't have any days to go to the university. I'm telling you something like this. I'm also telling you the same thing. You are a man. You are like a man in a police station. You are a man. I knew you would not think like us. I don't know if I came. I know that we are in the same place. You are saying that? No. There is a lot of belief in it. Everyone is thinking about it. When they say it is soft, when the cameras are not there, when they say it is soft, it becomes more comfortable. But when the cameras are there, when the camera is there, when the group is there, in general, they are very... They are very... Can I ask you a little more? Can I ask you something? Yes. Let's just do what I don't want to say. Since you were an actor, therefore you used to be six... Who wrote it down? From the core of the listeners. I will show you something somewhere else. That is, the same topic as the example. Meaning, achment attained such a special cultural heritage. Of producers. So, in terms of caring, particularly known artists and artists can the، as well, are the kind of things. a very special convenience store. That is, you know, the kind of market that includes a menu, the business, the business that has the right to be paid, and that is what the company has been doing. The beginning of the month, was that it was actually a business that was really very good in the city. Now, in that service, Ali Fazal Bey was a teacher, Then the next question is... The technique of course is more important part of it. It is something that has been prepared in its own way. Maybe... ...there may be some kind of friends who can help out with it. But the essence of our question is that... ...that is, our friends were in the same position. We don't do much about it. We don't respect it. We don't do it ourselves. We don't respect it. In fact, political arenas very different on that stage. There is very little to assert with that sense. Of course, the second question that bullshit is given by objects... ...value according to the principle, or skills of some people. It is a matter of sense. But when I was in the military, I would ask whether I am a very good person and I would ask the question. This is an interview with Zayf, a New Parliament. We saw the difference between Turkey and the region. Zayf was a parliament and a New Parliament. Look. The parliament was all linked to Turkey. All parties were linked to Turkey. But this parliament, according to the government, does not have a problem with the government. This is the reason why the government is not able to solve the problem. It is not possible to solve the problem. We cannot solve the problem with the government. We can solve the problems with the government. But I want to say this. It is all about the country that is not great. It is not possible to solve the problem with the government. It is a problem with the government. It is not possible to solve the problem with the government. I refer to this as a reference. But if you consider this as a note, the government will bring this system. This is a capitalistic system. It is a totalitarian system. The problem with a dividing system from 80 to 78. You saw it by seven times to 70 percent of this system. This problem went with theort 96 and 76 to the other basis of the agriculture clarified. First of all, weро Ash😌 We understand this by saying this. If you are 90% of this system, you can't sit on it. All of this was mentioned in this case. But you can't sit on it if you are 50% of it. Today, it's the end of the day. Now, the referendum was on it. But now, every time Dutphen wants to hold on to the moral of this country, his wife Yarası gives the democracy to her husband. So, this is the authority, this is the total authority. We are different from a different person. We are different. I know what it means. The criminal service party and what? What is their political system? They were all three political systems. What does it mean? And we have a democratic movement over the past. Look what happened here. All political systems were divided into two political systems. I mean, I've been to the newspapers, the milliers, the reliefs. The sun was the sun for the sun. The sun was the sun for the sun for the sun. But, the social democracy was located here. It was a second year. The youth democracy was on the side, and this was an authoritarian period. Now, the Meijis and Külsü and Millet and Cyasi parties are being formed. I mean they will be doing politics and I am telling them to all my friends. I cannot argue with them about politics in this party. Not only that, but I have never tried to do politics and insults and violate the judicial system. They will spend their lives on the rights of the people. Because politics and the manifestation of justice are not equal. And he was only a legal man. Ifade Özgürlü is the one who can get the votes. But you can control the American people, but All the women who will get the votes are very willing to get the votes. Because that woman will be the one who will get the votes of Ipade Özgürlü. The one who gets the votes of the innocent. There is the rule in the national law. I am a more reliable friend. I mean, there are nine parties in politics, but there is a special one in politics. So, it's going to be difficult to accept this, friends. It's a very important part of politics. There's a 300th special event in politics. We have to work to create a democracy, a strategy, and a relationship and power. We can be this way. We have to do something. Friends, my name is not Ms. from the government. If there's no chance, we can be sure to talk in the future. I would say what I should do with the JCP group, are the same in Turkey. I mean, we can say that the JCP group is completely different. We can say that that JCP group is totally different. Can they say that they want to talk about JCP group both in support of the JCP group? Do they want to talk about the JCP group? They want to talk about JCP group? This is a system that we're in Turkey again. We've told you about the latest systems that are already in the context of the Tayyip Bey. We've been telling you about the Tayyip Bey that we need to introduce and address for the Tayyip Bey's political power. But the Tayyip Bey's political power is not something that comes directly to the country, it's not something that comes directly to the country. It's something that we need to organize. is very likely to happen. A democratic change is actually happening. A country, a democratic country. A state that is in the forefront of the state and that is the state of the government, is a state of the government that is not in the form of a state. In fact, the state of the democracy is still in the form of a state. This is a state. I'm talking about some of my friends. I mean, this is not the end of the world. This is the end of the democracy. But if you use your democratic weapons in your democratic countries, you will be able to get anywhere you want. And if you look at it from a certain point of view, you will be able to achieve this right away. In other words, it is hard to achieve. It is hard to achieve. We both will be in the middle of a completely new and complicated conference. If we will give democracy or the democracy, what a great past or maybe a great future, I tell all the viewers that this positive effect of our society is zero-inclusive. They aren't talking, they aren't asking, they aren't selling things they're talking about. They aren't interested in some talking, they are giving it a top priority. They are talking about the fact we have one and two things to monitor here. This is a very different thing, this is a disgraceful thing. They always say the meaning of every Turkish word. and every thing that is being said is related to the first-class state. So, it is also said that every word of the word is related to the third-class state. Now, if you say that, it is said that the third-class state is related to the third-class state, it is related to the first-class state. Therefore, in this case, in fact, the problem that we have in our discussion about the new law is that we have such a situation. In 2002, the second-class state is the third-class state of the third-class state, the Turkish democracy, Turkish democracy, Turkish society, Turkish society, Turkish media, all these things, we see the results of what is still going on. In fact, this is not even prepared for this. So, we do not know how much we will be able to prove that we are not aware of this. So, in the meantime, we have always been aware of this. Maybe it's the subject of this. If you don't mind the principles of democracy, you can get a question. Of course, if we are a friend of ours, we have a system. We will show them the chance to choose something in the future. We are trying to develop this education. We started working at a company called the US-USD, the US-USD. Then we started working at the US-USD. We have a meeting with our partners, so we did not work, we were not working. If I were a company, I would be like a good friend. We were working together. and from that point forward, I always wanted to sort of testify to everything on the same day when we are together, whether in the party of interest, or in a place where we are aware of the way we work together we try to privatize the holds. It's a curse which means you want this to be a curse. You say you are supposed to be like this, but that's not how I am. Our friends said that they do a lot of things like this and they did some things to the public, their officials, their officials did good things as well. There is no issue if we are not doing it. Are you not seeing it like a prayer? The problem is that we are doing it as a prayer. You are seeing the thing that we are trying to do. When we see the same thing as a prayer, you are seeing the same thing as a prayer. Even if you are getting a theory and are trying to read the same thing, it is a situation that is important for a prayer. We are trying to do it. If you are looking for a prayer category, As you say, you don't have to do that. So, we are not going to have to do that. It is very difficult. But the government doesn't have to do that. The government doesn't want to do that. We have to be aware of that. But then, we have to be aware of the democracy. Because it is our country, it is not a matter of being aware of all of our things. But we need to go to the back of our North Korean side. The big country that will be more likely to be in the future. We are not going to be a part of the country, but we will be a part of the land. I started to develop a political culture. I see the story. We will do it from now on. I am happy because I worked in normal conditions. I did a program for you. I couldn't even see the show. I couldn't even see you. I was not able to see you. But I saw you here. You have something to eat. You are a great chef today. You are a great chef. There are new recipes for myself. There is this phenomenon in Parliament. There is nothing like that. The situation of the Parliament is tough. There is nothing like a project. There are people playing chess on the consoles. There is nothing like that. It's a democracy. There is a democracy that is very important to all parties. There is a competition. There are candidates in the elections. There is a competition in the elections. There is a competition. They have a competition. That's how it was. If you take care of your own problems, you would end up doing it, and start doing it. You just have to go. It's not like you see it in the future. In the future, you would take care of it, and you would find yourself a coach. You should do it there. 现在中国有很多围围,共产党有很多平台的民主队, 共产党都有,共产党有很多平台的民主队, 共产党有很多平台的民主队,共产党都有其他人, 共和党都有其他人,共和党都有其他人。 and was being called a pro-unitarian, so much so far. So, the world is like a world, a day, a day, a day, a day, a day? A day, a day, a day, a day, a day, a day, a day. A day, a day, a day, a day, a day, a day, a day, a day, a day. What kind of war will be going on here? What kind of war will it take? It is like this, and then. It is like this, and I think it is that way. That means, the system is the same. I would say that he really wants to do this to himself. Yeah. We don't agree, because he wants to do it. He is the one who is more honest because the father is not working. He is not in a position to do the job. He is not in a position to work. He is not working, he is not working. He is too young. I think that the father is not working. He wants to talk about the future of the G20 situation. he would be better. He would be better if he would. Does anybody have a message for that? Yes. We need to have that. We need those things too. There are many things to say. When someone says that there are many things... There are things that can be said. But look, this is something we call a patent. We call it the patent in its name. The last seven years, the war is not in the market. Or the economy is not in the market. That's why it's important to take a look at the market. Autocrossing. There are elections, but there are elections. There is a new Turkish model, which is called Putin. China is also a world-renowned country. It's a new Turkish model. But we are not ready to do this. We are ready to do this. You said it a little earlier. Yes, I mean, the teachers said that the situation is not right. You didn't work in Perşanbeda. After the competition, after the competition, there is no need to do that. Of course, I have a lot of expectations. I have to make a lot of progress. There is a crime scene in the Seçman taboos. They are not doing anything yet. I have to write a film. Yes, that's right. I came here from here. I came here from the city. I did a year in 16th June. I did a massive job in the press conference. I was in the first place and I came here. We had to open the media. Maybe not. I shared my opinion with you in 16th June. I asked them to do something that has been ordered with them for the 25-30 years. Like, such a great idea has been given to the senators. They were invited to do some sort of work. But the senators, despite the fact that they are the president of the senators, After the military coup, there was a chance that the military would have a chance to win the war. The military coups were made in the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Ottoman Empire. I am telling you that there is more information about that period of time. There are more information about that period of time. But we did the same job which led the men to fight. They took the men to the military barracks. They did the same job until 12 o'clock. Then a few soldiers were made. That's right. There are some interviews with governments who are not completely settled, but now to the end, now to the end. What is the result of the arguments? They beat the internet, and the internet cara happy! You have to understand beyond what they said in the TV. There was a whole group of people who were in the area of the plan B. There was a machine H.S. It was called Charlie Nadia. It was called the Jezalandir J.H.Mobil. There was a mobile H.Mobil. It was a machine H.M. That was H.M. He had the best chance to go to the 37th Hijab at the age of 26. But he was the last one to finish his Hijab, and he was the 4th and 8th Hijab. He was not afraid of anything. He was the last one to finish his Hijab and he was the last one to finish the Hijab. He was the last one to finish his Hijab at the age of 37. There are a lot of people standing in the very same area of the YZI-30-17. They were given the YZI-17 YZI-17. The same position is made in the same state. You have to make a YZI-18 YZI-30. You have to make the YZI-18 YZI-18 YZI-17 YZI-18. You have to make the YZI-18 YZI-18 YZI-18 YZI-18 YZI-18 YZI-18. But in the middle of the year, if you send a ticket to another location, you can send it to the middle of the mountains. That's how it is. You know what happened today? I did it on the 16th, I didn't see such a thing. After a week or so, I went to the airport in the middle of an airport. I took it out, I took it out, I took it out. The 3rd-gradier was taken from the city. The one who was chosen was the president of the city of Khoda. He was the leader of the government in the morning, who was the leader of the state. He was taken to the city of Khoda. And he was taken to the city of Khoda. He said, everyone could be taken to the city of Khoda. This is not the case in this area. The 12th-gradier was taken to the city of Khoda. They took their asses and took them to prison. Look at this. I mean I am telling you... to be a veteran of the Serbian forces, to have a role in the state of combat in Turkey. That's what it is. So, they make it happen? They don't make a video about it. They don't take the subject. But if you like the subject of the film, One of the people in the world had a lifetime of name and name. So the name was accepted. One of the people who lived in Turkey had one. They are standing on the rail and the service is being carried out. But then the government is holding on, I'll pass the service myself, otherwise you'll speak. It's a possibility to sit here and wait for the service to start. I don't understand. It's not a option to sit here but for a trip, I'm ready to go. I have a look at the situation. Now, this is the situation. This is the situation. The belief is not the right to believe. It is the most important situation. But it is 30 years old. It is 5 years old. Look at this. I am talking about that. There is a government. There is no parliament. There is no government. There are many people who need to be seen. Depending on which government has to be seen. Can you see? I think if they need to be seen, then the Government shouldmb this government. Give them a positive administration. They should notУ You. There is no Congress. It is impossible. In fact, there are no representatives of other government around the world. We are gettingcómo t Chocolate forнизitUTia. People expect these mentality. and we are not thinking of the possibility of a result of the possibility of a bad thing and that if we see that at the end of it is not a problem. At the moment there is the truth, we have been counting from the people and giving out a terrible decision in the future. I mean, these people have been counting on the people, they still, they still say too many people have been counting. ... because nothing was revealed in the news news and no news com is included. The truth was true, and there was no more news. Then, in the diaspora, the European Union carefully... ...means that a person who is not afraid of being brought to the United States... ...and the state government by the way that has been released from the government's press. There is no reason for the statement to be taken out of the case. There is no such a statement to be taken out. It is not the case right now. We are giving it a chance. But now there is a point of view. So view. How? I know that this is what I am saying. We can't look at the view. What if the view is taken out of the view? It is a lie. I know that this is what I am saying. I say this is how it is. But this view is what I am saying. There is a view in the eye of the person. He will not extend his hands any more. For example, if Uncleanya will extend his hand, but if he cannot... That is in the now. There is no such fact. Even if you are held out in the hands of a holy person... ...who are rather against the other person... ...he is afraid of the possibility of his own existence. However, I will now explain to you what the emergency is like. He tells a person in the opinion of an energetic person living in a place like this. Ifade Özgürlüğü, Jürnün Başkanlığa Kayet Falan Pilan. This is what they are talking about. Itra Zen çıkması istisnadır yani. Binde birdır. Belki binde bir bile değil. Yok çünkü. Beşinciyi öyle bir şey yaptılar ki, sistem getirilir ki. Hava borçlu bırakmadılar bakın. Eskiden sorgu akimi yapardı. Onun kararına siz assezza makinesi itra zilerdiriz. Çalene adyesi ne atıyorum. Yetmiş tane assezza makinesi var. O hafta ve o günahın kişinin öbetisi o bakar. Büyükün taniye etmeniz mümkün değil. Büyükün değil. Bugün tutuklandınız yarın atıyorum. Motü beşliği aslığı var. Ceza makinesi. Onun bir vesile ile onun mu karar vermeye ihtimali var diyelim yani. O onun mu karar vermeye. Yetmiş tane assezza makinesi kontrol edemezsin. Ne yattar biliyor musunuz? Sorgu işlerini. Yani bu tutuklama, salın verme, el koyma, dinleme işlerini. Dokuz on tane akime bağladılar. Biriden dokuzakada ona kadar. Su ceza akimlerine. Yetişince su ceza makinesi karar veriz zaman assezza itirac edemiyorsunuz. Altıya itirac ediyorsun. Altınca asya. Su ceza makinesi. Ay evet o. Yediği verirse sekize ediyorsunuz. Dokuz verirse bile dönüyorsunuz, bile yapıyorsunuz. Dolayısıyla sistemi böyle kurmuşlar. Ama sistem şeye doğru işliyor. Uyuşturucu baronlarına karşı işliyor. Nasıl işliyor? İşte bundan bir ay önce ortaya çıktı. Yani bir gazteci köşeye zarıyı yazdı ve yalanlanmadı o. İşim önemli değil ama hakim şunu söylüyor. Bir uyuşturucu baronu vakın İstanbul ota yerinde. Vuralarda yakın bir yerde yakalandı. İran kökü önüne bir adam. Yani bir, yani operasyon büyük bir operasyon. Yakalandı. İki üç tane polismem bile beraber ona yardım eden. Hepsi tutuklular bir şeyde. Davaları açılmamış. İşte itirazlar yapılıyor falan filan. Bir itirazlar çıktı. Yani cuma günü gece saat on bir de çıktı. Beşince de altıncana. Hakim hakim odun şimdi bilemiyorum tam olarak. Tabi olağın üstü bir şey. Hemen tikâyetini ve tutuklardı. Sonra ne oldu biliyor musunuz? Hakim'in beğenliği almışlar ve basına yansıduğu. Şeydir mi? Adalet ve kalkundan partisinin etkili bir ismi. Bana telefon açtı ve şunu söyledi bakın. Aslında orası çok önemli. Devlet hassasiyeti olduğu bu sanıkla ilgili olarak devlet hassasiyeti olduğu bana ifade edildi. Devlet hassasiyeti. Şimdi devlet hassasiyetiyle uyuşturucu bana tarihlgüyorsa. Adalet ve kalkma partisinin çizdi devlet anlayışında. O hassasiyetle acı makinler içeride şu anda tutuk alıyor. Aynı hassasiyetle. Böyle bir yargı düzeni var. Yani benim isyan etmem, kabul etmem, bundan dolayı. Ve böyle bir ortam var. Buna içeden ses çıkarmayan aslında hakimler, savcılar var. Ası itirazın içeriden gelmesi lazım. Yani yargı ortamından gelmesi lazım. Biz işte işe hadideriz konuşuruz bana. O iş yani. O itiraz etmanı oradan gelmesi lazım. Ben son olarak çok uzattım. Parkındayım. Yani üç gün önce şey vardı. Yargı strateji toplanısı vardı. Sen bakan açıklama yapmışsın av geliyor vesaire. Evet. Yani onun dıştan başındı. Birerda kalık, şey konuşmaları vardı. Anayasa mahkemesi başkanlığın. Yargı Tayyip başkanlığı, danış Tayyip başkanlığı. Konuşmaları vardı. Birerda kasıvala. Onu İngilizce ya Franscia çevirilseniz. Yani dersiniz ki bu acaba hang gülke de konuşulmuş. Ya konuşan kim acaba? Bir de böyle bir yargı var. Yani yargının böyle bir yüzü var. Yani hiçbir şey olmamış gibi konuşan mesela anayasa mahkemesi. Şunu söylemiştir. Mahkemesi başkanlığı. Uz, evet. Yargının besayat altlı almasının ve uzaktan kumandan idrimesinin hangi uksuzlukları yolaştığını tecrübe etmiş bir dönemden geçiyoruz ya da geçtik. Bunu söylüyor biliyor musunuz değil mi? Neyse. Yani ben o kadarını konuşacağım. Yani bir devlet anlayışı var. Yapılan her şeyin devletin ve kası büyük şeyin için yapıldığı söyleniyor. Bunu Yoruz Bey'e de soracağım. Çünkü hani özellikle milli yeti siyaseti bu önemli bir şeydir. Yani bazen devletin çıkarlarını konuda önüne koyabilmek vesaire vardır. Ama merkezi sağa siyaseti. Yani bu hukukma ilgili söyleyeceğiniz bir şey var mı? Yani bu aduriyetlerden. Evet. Birkaç şeyin otu aldım da birkaç noktaya değilmek istiyorum. Az önce devletin ve kası dediğiniz. Evet devletin ve kası önemli. Hepimiz için öyle. Fakat referendumla bir likte. Bu yeni anayasa ve yeni rejib anlayışıyla bir likte. Sayin Erdoğan şunu yapmaya çalıştı. Ve kısmende onu yapmaya çalışıyor. Kendi kaderini akparti ve devletin kaderini kendisine var. Yani ben gidersem devleti giden akparti giden. Akparti zaten şu anda bir iletişim birosuna dönmüştü. Yani özel kalem birosuna dönmüştü. Bunu söyledi kamar referendum öncesi. Yani bu sistem ile peşte benim birer şeyle. Nasıl söyleyeyim? Bayiline dönmüşterdir. Yani ona da sonunda tez bitedir. Ama çözümgüyü beş tepedir. Yani parlamento değil beş tepedir. Şimdi bakınız. Bu lafı siyasi dilten ötürümüzden hatırlanız. İktidar her yerde mevcuttur. Mevcuttur. Yani siyasi doğada şeyaf boşluk affetmez. Ama demokrasinin ölçüsü muhalefetin varlığı özgürlüğü ile ölçülebilir ancak. Bir defa siyasetin dili ve yapılmak istenen. Bakınız. Ne diyor bunu Türkiye'nin en üst makamı diyor. Akparti genel başkanınız fati ile diyor. Kah cumul başkanız fati ile diyor. Hain diyor. Mesela kime hain diyor. Kaha kalları hain diyor. Başka referendumda hayır veren kesime hain diyor. Biz aç ahidim. Terrorist diyor. İltibatlı diyor. İltisaklı diyor. En son bize zillet ittifakı dedi mesela. Millet ittifakına zillet ittifakı dedi. Yo bu nokta üzerinde duruyorum. Yani hem hukuken hem ahlakken duruyorum. Düşünün yani kendi ittifakını bir şekilde kutsayan bir kafa geliyor. Millet ittifakı adını verdiğiniz bir yapıya zillet ittifakı diyor. Öncelikle bu aşağılayıcı dilin hukuki bir problemi vardır. Ama bunun dışında, bunun dışında. Ben şimdi siyaset dışı konuşuyorum. Eğer aynı kitaba bağlı, ortaq bir ahliaka sahipsek, bu sözü sarfeden zillet ittifakı diyenin, sadece çıkıp milletten özür dilemesi ve bu ittifakta özür dilemesi yetmez. Aynı zamanda umumi sarfetliği için tövbe etmesi de gerekir. İnanmayan kitaba baksın. Bunu siyaset dışı söyledim arkadaşlar. Ahlak gibi yükümlülük olarak. Şimdi bu ikili değil, Sayın Tanrık olununu söyledi. Daima mevcuttu. Kaha kallardan da bu işte, her kezden bu işte. Yani zulmü yapacak ama siz kık çıkartmayacaksınız. Herhangi bir muhalefet yapmayacaksınız. Ve hiçbir şey yokmuş gibi anlatacak o sağda soldan. Yani ve bunun faydalı bir işlem olduğunu adeta savunacak. Bu arada muhalefete ve yargıya çok iş düşüyor. Evet, bu riskli bir alandır. Wedelde ödemeyi gerektirir. Biz parlamentoyu çalıştıracağız. Jardışlar da hukuk devletini çalıştıracak. Ve dayanışma içine gireceğiz. Başka yapılacak bir şey yoktur. Hukuk işletilecek. Hukuk devleti teyesi sedilmezse bu sistem hepimizin üstüne çöker. Çok büyük sosyal patlamalara neden olur? Buna ekonomik kızde eklendiği zaman. Bakın, ben Kayakadan benim atılışım. Kişi sevbenimden bahsetmeyi sevmiyorum ama önemli bir örnekti. Dördüncü atılışım bu benim arkadaşlar. Biliyor mu bilmiyorum. Daha önce 90'lı yıllarda 3 kez atıldım. O dönem illanetlileri yetici acılardı. Ben de o lanetlilerin içindeydim ama iyi kötü hukuk işliyordu. Yani Ankara Üniversitesi beni atıyordu. Mahkeme beni haklık olup bir birayı istemeden çiğnemiş olmama rağmen yönetmeli. Yani derne güyesi olmak rektörden yazılı izne tabiydi. Ben bunu atlamışım gerçekten bilmiyerek yaptım ama bu atlanan prosedürler rağmen. Mahkeme beni birayı lehine kullanarak şeyini, reini, görevme iade etti. Bu da bir kötü niyet yoktur mesai. Belki de bunu sözleşmeler çerçevesinde yorumladı. O yasayış şimdi. Son olarak bir şey söylemek istiyorum. Çok da böyle uçuk konuşmak istemiyorum ama Türkiye'nin bugünkü sorunu bilgilenmenin ve mantığın temel şeyleri. Temel şeyleri çalışmıyor. Mantık yani zihnimizdeki mantığın çalışması. Hepimizde ortak bir şey. Yani o işte yüz yıllar önce şey yapılan mantık kitaplarındaki temel konular. Ve bunu incelediğinizde ne atina geleneyinde ne vahigeleneyinde ne hristian geleneyinde o mantıkta bir bu tabakat görürsünüz. Sağlıklı uzlaşmak yanında sağlıklı düşmanlıklar da o mantığın kullanılması ile alakalı bir şey. Fakat bugün bu tahri bedeliyor. Bundan önce inanın bana ahlakın zemini tahri bedeliyor. Yani iyile kötülün anasındaki fark kalkıyor. Bir kişinin ağzından çıkan bunu söyleyince şey yapıyorlar, sinirleniyor ak partili arkadaşlar ama. Bir kişinin ağzından çıkan haşa Allah kelamın da adeta üzerinde tutuluyor. Ve onunla çelişme menin yolları aranıyor. Şeydeki suskunluk davandandır. Yani ak parti gurulundaki bu hani dinginlik değil o sessizlik o suskunluk. Söylemek istediğimiz şütür. Bunlar insanların kendi vahaguluşunun temel şeyleri diri mekanizmalarıdır. Bilgiye ve mantığa duyarsızlık da aynı zamanda ahlakı bir sorun bakın. Yani doğruya doğru dememekta ahlakı bir sorundur. Doğruya reddetmekta ahlakı bir sorundur. Yani işimiz gerçekten kolay değil ama tekrar ediyorum. Türkiye'de, Türkiye'de bu rejime aşağıya kadar Türkiye'nin yarısı diri veriyor. Bu müthiş bir siyasi şeydir. Başlangıç ve sermayedir. Ben bunun artacağını, ölümün açık olduğunu ve bu kesimin artacağını düşünüyorum. Bir ara bir yerlerin hızlıca dönmeyecek aldığımız yerden devam edelim. Şimdi baktığı kaldığımız yerden devam ediyoruz. Meclisi ve hukulu konuştuk ve ortak bir değil oluşturmayı. Bunun belki de Türkiye'de demokratikleşmesine nasıl etkiyedeceğini, sana yahuuz arali oğuz nasıl olarak devam edin efendim. Yani bir şikayet ediyoruz ama çözüm yolu da var mı? Siz ne nasıl görüyorsunuz meclisin içinden? Ben dışında. Şöyle. Tüksiye'de siyasaliklim. Gerçekten, hernız konuşması gereken şeyleri konuşabilme imtiyazını vermedi bize. Bizim bu kadde satçılığımızın konuşması gerekenler. Milliyetiliğimizin konuşması gerekenler. Cumhuriyetilerimizin konuşması gerekenler. Türkiye'de sarsılmaz bir iktidar algısı içerisinde bu kadar güç temer küzetmiş bir yapıya karşı, bir okrasimizin konuşması gerekenler. Akademimizin konuşması gerekenler. Bin bir okrasimizin konuşması gerekenler. Şimdi Selgin Beyşeh'den müşdeki böyle bir mekanizma görmedik. Aslında birbirimizden çok farklı kullanmadık hükümet etme şeklimiz. Ben Mehmet Molta'yı zamanlarında mesela şöyle cümleler hatırlıyorum. O zaman bizim, sen müjram ettin muslim başkanla ayrılma gerekçelerimizden aslında kattığımız bücümledir o bizim. Meyhefe'den ayrılma gitsam zamanlarında. İşte buraya bunları almayacaktım. Dülkücülerimi alacaktım sistemi. Bir adalet bakanın sözü olarak geçti kayıtlara. Şimdi benzer lapları 20 sene sonra da duyuruz. Onları almayacağız da bunun aslında hükümet etme imkanı ele geçince. Yaptıklarımızın birbirinden çok farklı yok. Eskiden siyasetin paylaşımı böyle değildi. Yirmilerle, yirmi ikilerle, on sekizlerle, on dörtlerle, on beşlerle. Mutlaka bir centirmenli kukuku etrafında bu işleri gelişiyordu. Nobran davranmak isteyenler. Bunu çok hudutu hale getiremiyorlardı ki. Çok yakın bir zaman sonra mecbur kalabiliriz diye. Aslında fiydi bir centirmenlik anlaşması da vardı. Şimdi aralıksız 16 yıllık iktidar. Yerine de başka bir şeyin gelemeyeceğine değer bir kabule dönünce. Bir okrasinin gardu düştü. Yani adli bir okrasi, on beşten bu skorkusunu şuna dönüştürü verdi. Fetöce olmak korkusundan karar veremez hale geldi. Elci oldu. Yani bu korkuyu bestiyecek bir dehşetlili devletin de dili haline gelince. Bu sefer ben elimdeki dostumda. Yani bu korkuyu bestiyecek bir dehşetlili devletin de dili haline gelince. Bu sefer ben elimdeki dostiyanın içerisinde neyin olup neyi olmadığına bakmayayım. Sadece üstüne bir şey değildirmene geçin ben fetöce olarak kadar. Yargıladığım adamı fetöce edeyim kolaylığına düşmüş oldu. Şimdi burada tükümetin dehşetlili dilinden çok. Ne uzetmemiz gereken şey şu. Biz bu çocukların nasıl okutuyoruz ki bunlar. Bir siyasi güç karşısında bu hale gelebiliyorlar. Aslında büyük problemlerimizin konuşulma zemini burasıksin. Yani bir siyasetin bu kadar üstüpsuz davranmasından bunun böyle olduğunu düşünüyoruz. Ben biraz daha buna farklı bir perspektitem bakıyorum. Ben Tayyip Bey hükümet etme şeklini devletin imkanlarını kullanma şeklini. Bu mannaketdeki siyasal savrulmanın sebebi saymıyorum. Ben Tayyip Bey sonuç sayıyorum. Afhan sonuç. Tayyip Bey bir sonuçtur. Türkiye'deki rokratik sosyoloji. Akademik sosyoloji, yeni sosyoloji, ihtimai sosyoloji. Yani bizim aslında varlık alanı bulduğumuz. Ve kendimizi idda inşa edeceğimizi, idda edeceğimizi her zeminde biriktirdiğimiz ne varsa o Tayyip Bey doğrdu. Dolayısıyla aslında bu kovmetimiz yokmuş. Aslında bir hukuk notionumuz yokmuş. Aslında milliyetimiz müstakil şahsiyetleri inşa edememiş yetiştirememiş. Aslında akademik camya. İlim adam olma haysiyetini her şeyin üstünde tutabilmek ahlakına sahip olamamış. Aka hissistinalları var. Bilim yapmıyor ama bu kovmet. Eşikleri birer birer kırılınca Tayyip Bey yaptı demektense biz zamanında doğru inşa etemedik demeyi tercih edir. Öyle ediyorum. Çünkü nihayetin de var olan bu kovmet eder. Var olan direner. Bu direneniyorsa üzerinde de konuşmak zorunda olduğumuz bir şey. Tayyip Bey'in sıralama hataları onun siyasi algoritmasıyla alakalı. Efendim enflasyon sebef, faiz sebef enflasyon sonuç demek. Onun siyasi algoritmasıyla alakalıdır. Beka meselesi var. O yüzden böyle yapıyorum demek. Onun siyasi algoritmasidir. O sıralama böyle yapıyor. Ben ters bakıyorum. Yani devletimizin bir beka problemi yeni yok her zaman var. 1701 yılında buraya girdik. Biz buraya girdiğimiz, irademizi beğen ettiğimiz ve irademizi etekemeye biründürdüğümüz günlerden beri. Sanat Tatsokha, şiire, mimariye, dile, musikiye, her tarafa nakşeptiğimiz varlık iddamızın bir tarafa da şudur. Bizim buradaki varlığımızı kendisi için kendi aleyhine, tehlike görenlerin bizim varlığımızda musallat olduğu bir bin yılımız var burada. Dolayısıyla bir beka problemimiz bizim her zaman var. Ama bizim beka problem ne? Beka problemimiz var diye bir endişeye cevabımız hep şu olduğu adalet. Hep şu olduğu daha güçlü olmak, işini düzgün yapmak. Yani ben bu menekette beka problemi var mı? Kız ben katılıyorum beka problemi oldu. Ama bunun sebebinin bu yönetim şekli olduğunu düşünüyorum. Yani beka problemimiz var diye bizi kendisine borçlandıran hükümetimiz. Bilsin ki beka probleminin bu düzeyde, bu dehşetle hissedilebilir olmasın sebebi. Ve fenden yönetim şekli. Yani beka problemi nasıl olur ülkenin? Hazinesi boş olursa olur. Yattırımları verim, sorursa olur. Eğitim, miliyetim. Bakanların. Yani istatistik sonuçlarına baksınlar. Pisces sonuçlarına baksınlar, yayınlandı. Eğitim durumlarımızı ortalayan bizi dünya sıkalasında bir yere koyan o bütün derecilendirmelere bakım derelerdeyiz. O zaman beka probleminiz olur. Liyakati değil de tavsutla ben yandaşları istitem ederseniz beka probleminiz olur. Ülke de nimet kültvet dengesini ayarlayamazsaniz beka probleminiz olur. Bu ülke de üretimi yetim bırakır. Rantı çok kuvvetli hale getirirseniz beka problem olur. Yani aslında bu beka problemi dediğimiz iş aslında. Ülke kötü yönetildiği için olur. Dolayısıyla siyaset zaten bu anlamda bir rekabet alanıdır. Yani kendisinden daha iyi yönetileceğine dair birtakım iddialarla siyasal organizasyon. Kurulur. Herkes kendisinden önceden gelenden daha iyi bir Türkiye tasavurnun, daha iyi bir Türkiye hayalinin partisi olarak milletin karşısına çıkar. Çok azidir bu. Şimdi bu eskiden rekabet diye adlandırdığımız şey, şu anda AK Parti'nin siyasal üstübu sayesinde hasımlığa döndü. Yani biz Tayyip Bey'in düşmanı değiliz. AK Parti'teki arkadaşlarımızın düşmanı değiliz, rakibiyiz. Ama AK Parti'teki arkadaşlarımız muhalefeti düşman gibi görüyorlar. Yani kendilerine münhasıran tazsidilmiş bir şeyi ellerinden almaya kalktığımızı zannediyorlar. Tayyip Bey kendisinden önce ülkeye yöneten siyasi iktidarlardan daha iyi bir Türkiye vaadetti. O vaadettiği Türkiye adına milletin yetki aldı. Biz de Tayyip Bey'in yönettiği iktidar, daha iyisiniyor. Bu yarış dediğimiz mekanizma böyle çalışır. Demokrasilerde hep daha iyisini yapmak iddası yarın endişelerine iyi gelen mekanizma olduğu için tercih edilir. Yani bu insanların kendi geliştirebildikleri en ehven yönetim modelidir. Dolayısıyla bunun mek bu mekanizma içerisinde biz veka problemlerimizi aşabiliriz. Şimdi siz kendi ülkenizin kaynaklarını yönetirken. Bu kadar hudutsuz kazanma şehvetine. Kendi yandaşlarınızla beraber teslim olursanız bu ülkede kuralı kaydayız, zor tuttursunuz. Kendinizin hesap vermekten imtinayetliği mahkemelere başkalarını davet edip hesap versin diye çağramasınız. Siz kendiniz istisnası olmayı heves ettiniz. Hiçbir ilkei başkalar uysun diye onlara icbare demezsiniz. Kendiniz fedakarlık edemezsiniz. Milletinizden fedakarlık isteyemezsiniz. Bugün haklı cümleler var aralara serpiştirilmiş. Ben cümur başkanının her söylediğine böyle bühtaneden bir siyasal muhalefeti çok mankul bulmam. ET ile ilgili itirazlarını ben makul buluyorum. Malkul buluyorum. Bunun ekonomiyi getireceği yüküzlerindeki hassasiyetler çok anlaşılabilir buluyorum. Doğru diyor cümur başkanım. Ama milletin bu cüretinin arkasında şu var. 4 milyonın soriyeliye bakıyorsan kardeşim bana da bakacaksın. Yani bu cüretinin arkasında nimet külfettengesini ayarlayavamış olmanın cüreti de var. Dolayısıyla sen kendine 455 milyon dolarlık bir uçak alabiliyorsan bakabiliyorsan araştırabiliyorsan neyse. Bu kadar işin arasında benden fedakarlık istemak hakkında kaybetmiş oluyorsun demektir. Cümur başkanımız siyasi pratiyi itibariyle at parti değerler dünyasına ait olan bir siyasal gelenekten gelmiş olmalara itibariyle böyle netameli zamanlarda. Böyle sıkıntılı zamanlarda. Böyle ekonominin insanların evini hanesini yaktığı zamanlarda bu kar bilbir siyasal yerinein yapması gereken şey kendine bir suyasi itibar suyikastik gibi uçak almak değildirmesi. Uçak satmaktır. Normal şartlarda Tayyip Erdoğan'ın siyasi algoritması siyasi pratiyi tabii ki. Kimsesizlerin kiminin palan gibi bir siyasi retorikle Türk siyasetine Bismillat demiş bir organizasyon. Simite Savi'la Asgari Ücreti, Iktidar Aleyhine, Kendi Lehine, Kuvete çevirmiş bir siyasi pratihin. Bugün Konkordotaylanlarının peşpeşe geldiği bir zeminde. İnsanların geçin darlığından intiharıların eşiğine geldiği bir dönemde. Sanayjilerin, sanayjilerimizi birer böyle dükkan kapattığı. Kefen kapattığı. Fakat kapattığı. İşçilerimizin çiftçilerimizin dargellerilerimizin. Emeklilerimizin hepsinin fevaran halinde geçin darlığı çektiği ve krizin artık dayanılmaz hudutlara vardı. Bir hengâhmede. Bir vasatta. Siz kendinize uçak falan kalamazsınız. Yaparsanız ki şöyle bir şey dersiniz ki arkadaşlar. Devletin itibare. Devlet alanların bindiği şeyler dendir diye bir şey söylemiştim ama bu bolluk zamanını sözüdür. Şimdi darlık zamanını nişi şudur. Bütün uçaklarımı satılacak. Satarsanız uçakları. Millet ona bakar. Derseniz ki ben yüz yüz yüz otuz yüz kırk tane arabayla geziyorum ama bir araba bir koruma kafidir. Satıyorum yüz elli tananın yüz kırk sekiz tanesini. Millet onu görür. Kendi yanınızdan yakınızdan başlarsanız millet bu yapmaya çalıştığınız hassasiyeti anlar. O zaman milletinize tahammül diyebilirsiniz. Ama siz 60 bin liralık maaşınız. 70-60 bin liraya çıkarırsanız geçinemiyorum diye vatandaşınızdan fedakarlık isteyemezsiniz. İsterseniz vatandaşınızın size mukabelesi şudur. Bu seçim sürecinde yine bize doğru şeyleri konuşma imkânı vermemek için ittifak şer ittifak azillet ittifak. Millet ittifak. Cumhur ittifak. BK problemı falan diye bir şey yapmaya çalışıyorlar. Bunun arkasındaki sayık budur. Yani vatandaşın gerçek gündemiyle mevzuyu konuşabilme imkânı delinden almaktır bu. Yani biz şimdi yerel seçimleri konuşuyoruz. Şehirlerimizi konuşamıyoruz. Dör. Yerel seçimleri konuşuyoruz. Bu şehirlerimizin teslim olduğu beton anarçısını konuşamıyoruz. Aslında biz iyi parti olarak. Türkiye'de ülkeyi kim yönetsin? Kavgasının sebeb olduğu sıkış baya. İyi gelecek bir siyasi iddiala çıktık. Biz ülkeyi kim yönetsin kavgasının parti değiliz. Biz ülkeyi ne yönetsin iddialasının parti is. Ne yönetsin? Ülkeyi kim değil? Önce ne yönetsin? Ülkeyi ahlak yönetsin. Ülkeyi zerafet yönetsin. Ülkeyi hakkı hukukut canından aziz bilma duyguz yönetsin. Ülkeyi devletin malanı her şeyden aziz bilma hlak yönetsin. Ülkeyi kendinden olmayan insanların da ülkesi bilme sorumlu yönetsin. Ülkeyi tahammül yönetsin. Ülkeyi teyendi yönetsin. Ülkeyi hoş göre yönetsin. Ülkeyi kendi yanını yandaşını kayırmak değil. Hak edene hak ettliğim evkeye getirme sorumlulu yönetsin. Şimdi bunların etrafında bir elbise bir siyasal sorumlu gelbisesi dikelim. Bunlara sahip olan kimse o yönetsin gelsin. Ama Türkiye'de siyasal iklimin Tayyip Bey kendi lehine şöyle avantajer çevirecek yönetsin. Çekilde yönetiyor. O mu yönetsin? Ben mü yönetiyim. O mu yönetsin? Ben mü yönetiyim de. Evet. Avantaj ile hale geldiğini bildiği için siyasalın, siyasal alanın iklimine de terrorize ediyor. Yani kendisini hayır da muhalefeti şerde. Kendisini beka da bizi yıkımda göstererek bir kategorize ettliği siyasal alanı kendi kuvvet haline çevirmeye çalışıyor. Bunun rekabet için anlaşılabilir tarafları vardı. Ama belli bir marjdan sonra Türkiye gibi etrafın ateşlerin yaladığı bir ülke. Türkiye'de artık sınırlarımızın dibinde eskiden müttefik saydığımız insanların bize vurabilecek terror unsurlarıyla müttefik olma sürecini yaşadığı bir zamanda Türkiye'de siyasal değil. Yüzde elli, elli, elli, biri konsolüde etmeye meyletmez. Yüzde doksana yürür. Biraz önce Cijangir Bey söyledi. Bazen siyasal iklim. Yüzde 30larla daha önceki sistemin aslında avantajıdır Tayyip Bey'e verdi. 34.7 idi galiba. 34.3 idi galiba. 34.7 idi galiba. Tamaçılamıyor. Onunla aldıkları saysal avantaj. 363. Yani ilk aldıklar. 363. Şimdi o zaman aldıkları avantajı rağmen. 34ten daha bağımsız bir şey vardı. Yakaladılar onu. Bazen öyle isabetli şeyler yaptın her ki. Yüzde 34 oya rağmen. Bazen meşouyet, elli, bazen atmış, bazen yetmiş oldu. Dur. Yani yetmiştene oldu şimdi. Yalanın dışında oyu, oyu da destek oldu. Normal oy havzalarının dışında yaptığı pek çok makul işin. Millet vidanda karşılığı oy vermezsekte doğru. Bunları siyasi olarak desteklemiyor olsak da yaptıkların çok makul buluyoruzdan. Yüzde 60'ları, 70'ları, 80'ları bazen olabilir. Bir meşouyet alan oluşturdu. Elilerini imke verdi. Şimdi yüzde elli. O yüzden yüzde 49.50 diye Cengir Bey'in söyledi. Ne ilave ediyorum bunu. Fazlası var. Yüzde elli, oy. Yüzde 25 meşouyet bazen. Bazen yüzde yirmi meşouyet. Eskiden ceketimi koysam. Alırım siyasi partisi de at parti. Ceket koysam alırım. Kimi koysam alırım. Çünkü nereye, kimi koyduğundan bağıpsız. Her yerde Tayyip Erdoğan'ı oy veren bir siyasi al meşouyetin avantajı vardı. Şimdi sadece makul makbul insanlar koyarsam alırım geldi. Yani ben buraya herkesin sebebileceği. Herkesin oyalabilecek adamlar koyabilirsin alırım. Oraya geldi. Şimdi belli ki aslında bir bu da böyle bir tabi ki. Bu bir denetimi imkanı verecek bize. Bu bir aşınma sürecinin kabulı anlamına geliyor. Yani ben artık milletin tevetçü edebileceği, sebebileceği, milletin problemlerini çözebilecek bir. Aday profiliyle çıkmak zorundayın. Doktasına geldi. Şimdi Belediyecilik. Belediyecilik özellinde bizim konuşmak zorunda olduğumuz bir sürü iş var. Bugün ki yaşadığımız iktisadi krizin. Hatta biraz daha gereğe getirin. Fetöcüler'in finansman imkanlarını devşirebildiği organizasyon. Belediyeciler mağarfehile kullan organizasyon dur. Yani aslında belediyeciliğin, ak parti belediyeciliğinin iki türlü savrolması oldu bize. Birincisi bu Fetöcüler denilen Zümren'in maddi konforunu Belediyecilik'teki imar emsel artışlar olur. Çok duyup. Dolayısıyla o limar emsel artışlarından doğan rantda siyasi beraberliğin beraberinde getidi ticari beraberlikler vardı. On beş Temmuz'a kadar bu sermaya yıldı. On beş Temmuz'dan sonra mal devir testimlerine bakılsın diye aslında arkadaşlarla önergeveriyoruz. Reddediyorlar. Çünkü SS problem bu finansman kuvvetinin nereden geldiği? Çünkü Türkiye'de ak parti belediyeciliği sonarlardan keşfettiler ki o aslında Türk üretim bandını da bozan bir şeydir. Yani otuz kırk yıllık sahicilerin imar emsel yoğunluk artışlarıyla karlılır. Tabii. Çok artıralmış binalarla mukayese edilmez karlılıkları. İnsanlar üretimden inşaat에 inşaat sektörüne belektirdi Dolayısıyla. Türk ekonomisinin şu anda karşı karşıya bulunduğu büyük krizi. Hem de Türk siyasetini felceden Fetöcüler'in büyük kalkışmasındaki güç ve iltaplanma at parti belediyeciliğinden oldu. Dolayısıyla at parti belediyeciliğinin hesabını doğru görmemiz lazım. Onu konuşmayan kendimize vermemek için sancımı başkanı şöyle yapmaya başladı. Şereptifak. Zilletitifak. Aslında onu konuşacağız. Çünkü nihayetin de bu milyarlarca dolarlık bir sermaya kaçışının da arkasında ki on beş temmuzdan sonra bunlarla ilgili belki bu dönem çıkmaz ama mutlaka çıkacak. Görüceksiniz. Mal devir testimleri, tapu devir testimleri. Tapuların birbirlerine intikali. Onlar üzerinden da ayrıca. Orlar da sonra yurt dışına finansman çıkışı. Sermaya çıkışı. Onlara bakasın. Orda bu ilişkilerin iltaplandırdığı nerelerde kirliği ilişkilerin odu ortaya çıkacak. İkincisi bu iman emsel artışlarının borzluğu şehir yapılarımız üzerinde bir şehircilik muhasebesi olmayacak mı? Bu universiteler neyin hesabını yapacaklar? Neye yarayacaklar bunlar? İstanbul gibi dünyanın en güzide 5-10 tane şehinden birini bu hale getirmiş olmanın hesabını sadece Cumhurbaşkanı. Biz bu şehre ihanet ettik. Yani yatay mimariye dönmemiz lazım diyerek atlatabilir mi? Bu elimize 1000 yıldır geçmiş en kıymetli hazinerlerden birini bu kadar berbat etmenin. Sadece siyasi sorumluluğum var. Bunun kültüre sorumluğu yok mu? Bunun mimari sorumluğu yok. Bunun tari sorumluğu yok mu? Yani hafızalarımızı kaybettiğimiz şehirde ruhumuzu kaybettiğimiz. Medeniyet iddialarımızın tamamını canına okuduğumuz. Bu şehirleşme. Bu model. Bizi dünyada hang yarışta kulvardak tutacak? Yani şehirlerine böyle yapan bir milletin. Neimanesi böyle olan bir milletin. Buna bağlı olarak savrulan şey sadece kazançlar üretim bandının kapanması mıdır? İnsan profili. Sanat profili. Sanatçı profili. Sokağın içerisinde kaybettiğimiz ailelerimiz. Sokağın içerisinde kaybettiğimiz vurduğum duymazdığımız. Tabii. Yani kaybettiğimiz insanlığımız bunun hesabını vermek zorunda olan bir dikti darın. Yereli yönetimlerde bize konuşturma imkanını vermeyeyim diye yaptığı tenez vetteyi şey. Kemal Kılıçlar oldu da bir fetöce çıkarmaya kalkmaktır. Yani Kemal Kılıçlar oldu da ki ki... O itifakın ış זה. Kei parti yapacak. B주는 bir benefit Кişi. Biz şunu demek istemiyoruz. Biz de böyle dörtbaşıme hamur Muhalefat böyle... Her mevzda yaknesak bir görüntü içinde olmak zorunda. Melendi değil. Değil. Ama bir tahammül eşiği oluşuyor. Burada biz CHP trazdarımız var. for the Earth. There are some things we have. We have a lot of things, for JCP, we have nothing. There are places where we can find those things that are not there for us. And to us, we have our own daughter, our daughter Drumders. These are not ours. Asgaris, the realm of politics is the present. Since this is not for them. We are ready for the history of the Entscheidung of theigkeit We are willing to try to find a place where we can give more time. And here, For example, a group of people who have lost their rights, they have to be a part of the event. The second party in Turkey, Soldan Filanca, Sadan Filanca, Estim Marxist, Estim-Villain, Estim-Villain, Liberals Filanca, Kürtler, Kürteller, Türkçiler, Siyasal Kadrosin, they can be a part of the movement of the Siyasi movement. This was the main event. It was a great event. What was it? In Turkey, all the Siyasal groups, were brought to a place in the Siyasi Potas. We don't say who they are. It's a thing that you bring to a place. It's the reason for the Siyasi movement. What did we say? There is something... Siyasi had mentioned that I am also one of the ones that I have who I can share with myself. This is all about Siyasi. It's about the thing you respect and your pain. The reason is... What do you ask in the end of the event? Siyasi. The reason for the Siyasi movement and the Siyasi movement. A whole new way for Siyasi. For example, I'm a young age. I'm in the young age. But in the past, people can say that in the years of the afterlife they can share the logic of the past. So, in the experience of the past, the list of arguments of the past, and the bottom of the quiz from the previous one, I'm saying this by saying it by doing this, I would say it by saying, that they had such a problem, it would have happened another day, it would have been like the previous one of those, 17, 18, 25 or 25 years before, and it would have been like this for 7 or 8 years. As for this research, they are in that world they can share that logic. They are still in that world. They have already mentioned such things in the past, and look, I have made the conclusion for these three things. I started to feel like an old man as a kid. I mean, I'll say that I am a kid, but you're like someone who's got a lot of stuff going on. You have a lot of life, a lot of work, a lot of work, lots of work, a lot of people, ... I mean, because you want to say this, why do you say that? In other words, if we look at the profile of people who are interested in the world of the world, we see that people are interested in this. For example, our own world, we have to deal with the world of the world of the world. We can't do that. In Turkey, I think it's the first time for us to be able to live in Turkey. We can't be able to communicate the world of the world by using a proper political system. We can't communicate the world by using a proper political system. But we think that it's the first time for the world of the world to be able to communicate the world by using a proper political system. It's a great opportunity. Thank you. Of course, this is the case. I think if you believe in what you see, you think of what you think and what you see... ...what I can imagine as a principle, it's like a moral thing. I can tell you exactly. You can write an taped paper, a tape or anyDEIN, They said, there is such a vague relationship. That's because you can't believe it, you can't live longer, you can live longer, and not understand. Nothing really understood. Now, it's not a matter of time. The system changed. In the early 18th century, I came from within the United States. There were some other issues that we had. I mean, we didn't understand the system, we didn't understand anyone. I don't know what to say. We didn't understand the state laws. We didn't understand the universities. But today, the system didn't change. So, this time, we went out of the AKPATIL. We wanted to understand the AKPATIL. And we went out of the AKPATIL. We wanted to talk to the people, talk to the people about themselves, about what they are doing when they are killed. When it comes to the AKPATIL, the AKPATIL, in general, has a very realistic party. 28 UAH and Turkey have to continue to support this. It is a fact to say that the country is changing its business. It has not changed its business. It has had other devices that have already entered the USA. They have already put other things into it. The change of business has not changed its business. The state of the state has the feeling that it is due to the administration and its decision on this, that it is due to the support of our state's leadership. I say it is due to the support of our state, but it is due to the support of our state, that it is due to the support of our state as well as the state's leadership. The state will face those things to the most. The system of our country is a part of our politics To find out the job of a painting, we would like to ask the artist to put it in the same place. But I don't want to be afraid of the owner. Because we can't accept the idea of a painting. You can't accept a painting. You can't accept a painting of a painting. Nevertheless, whether the government sends the Soviet troop or the Soviet troop, or the state should receive a confirmation of the mission that will continue to be concluded. Of course, they should not make a vote for the votes, they should vote between the vote and the instance that goes to the head of the group and the猪. But they should not be too generous and be too generous. We can talk about the details further. Always are you ready to finish your work? Yes. You are already learning about it. Do you have no chance to end this? I do not do that. I just see that the changes in the current, the changes in the current, the change in the future... For some reason Rutkaşti. The change in the future doesn't change anything. But we are here now. The Turks say that in the general elections, the communists say that they have to get to the point of the elections. They are now in the hands of the Turks. Because he is an old man, he is an old man and he is an old man. He is an old man, and he is an old man, and he is an old man. He is not being a vile man. He is changing his mind and his mind. He is changing his mind and his mind, but he is changing his mind and his mind. Yes, Mahalif is being influenced by his enemies. Why does he want to live in his enemy's politics? Why? Because if you make an objective politics, if you make an empty and lovely impression on him and the bad person. You can follow the right path then, but don't let it take away from you. If you do not take away, you get along with your family. If you were able to get along with your family, you would make your life miserable. You could not spend the rest of the money here or there and bring the people out of the hotel. Nepotism, that is, the old and old-fashioned understanding, has also been seen a few things. It is called this clientism. It is a kind of a human being. He wants to give his own opinion. Look, all the citizens don't need that talent, that talent. He wants to do something with himself and his work. Now, I want to talk about ITTFEC and things. We are very, very different... ...it's a nightmare to choose and join ITTFEC. We will win. Looks like we will unite ourselves... ...we will join ITTFEC. But it's our time to talk about ITTFEC. It's our time to talk about the idea of the new job of ITTFEC. First of all, we all share the party, as a private party, as a public party, as a public party. People are a political party, a legal party, a political party, a political party. This country, the legal party, the political party, the political party, is what we want to do. Every time we get together, we get together. When the CFF was coming to the CFF, there was a coalition with the CFF in 1974. It was about 77-88 years. It was the second party of the MCE, the Hükümet. When it was the end of the year. No, no. Now it's the end of the year. I'm telling you that. You have such a thing in your mind. Yes, I want to tell you how to make it happen. It's called Refah Yoldönem. There is a coalition in the right part. We don't have a separate part in the party. I think it's like that. Now, when the CPH and the Coalition came, the 9th of July in Haziran. When the AK Party set up the Dharbe 7, the CPH was not able to do the fake operation. The Coalition doesn't see the CPH in Haziran. Did you want to do the coalition? It did. Do you mean that it's not going to happen, Muhtemeler? It's going to happen. At the beginning. That was a 200-million dollar offer. That means, it's not going to happen. and I don't want to forget about the past, I don't want to accept such things, I want to keep with J.P. and the coalition in that area. It's a great support, it's a new Taiwan coalition. We all will be able to create a new coalition, we will all be free in Turkey, They have to talk like this. So, from the perspective of the matter, the way we do the work, and from the perspective of the matter of the situation, we all have to make sure that we are all ready to do this. We are the people of the age, from the principles of the situation. We are going to do politics and work. If you say it once, at least once or twice, look at the economy. We don't know much about the value of the nationality. You see the concept of the situation, right? I call it the value of the nationality. We don't know how much the Bahar is going to be, so we don't know what is going to happen. That means, there is no way out. What happened to the money? The money was spent. The money was spent in the money, for the money. The money was spent on the money, for the money was spent on the money. It is a bad thing. These days, emails are coming to you. They are asking for the money. Now they are sending you a message. Every email in the social channel is so clear. Check this, if you clear this search report, you die as a burden. When you buy your burden, you get a限. You are not left behind. You die as a burden. These cheats will increase in 500億. They will no less than that. But they will remain here. Gets sick when it comes to money trading. I will let you know that the time is over. All the time, you are in front of the head, everything is in front of the head, people have done nothing but this. I mean, I see that I have shown that you have not recognized that. May Allah protect us. People have changed their lives at once. It is not a joke, but there is something like this, that is, the situation in which the men and women You can be as much as possible with all of you. You can share your blockages with us. But... The issue of the issue of the issue is that we all have the same interests. Then, let me tell you the reason. Look, we can't be the most popular in the country. We can't be. We can't be the most popular in our country. But this country is the most powerful, the most agile, and the most democratic in our country, the mostbaar-shined, so that we can have initiative and that there is no religion in the country. We can't do things differently. Not without any religion, but to finish our issue. That's right, I'm over it. Now we can start making our workative, with participation of Fred Domivocchi. I see the apartment area. Yes, we are talking about that. So you're the one who's more interested in the event. Yes, I'm very interested in that. Because we were made to be a big fan of the event. We were making fun of this event, so we wanted to talk more about that. You talked too much about it. Not much. My ideas were very important. We should listen to the difference. There are some things that we have in the past. In the last three or four years, there was a new dengue in Turkey. There was also a dengue in the first place. There was a dengue in the modern era. Now, when he was still in the pre-season, he said that this crisis would be called the period. I mean, we were going to see a crisis in Turkey. They are working for the city, the local elections, the local elections, the local elections and the local elections. They are doing the first event in the city. In other words, we should see the situation from all the members of our party. In addition, to look at the situation, in order to achieve the right level of the party, we should make a decision for the region itself. So, if the party members are on that side, we should make a decision for the leader. we can see that it takes place since the end of the century. We must have a new mechanism with what we need. And it took us far away to the end. We have lived in moment, a clear hope, when the economic crisis takes place in Turkey. If a government came here and said, I want to see this in the final period of the year. It took us several years, not to be a part of it. At the end of the year, we may remember the time We have this institution that can stand right and not lose people, to fight againstС bad guys, need us as maintain their own laws at a certain time. This is going to be a long way, but this goes forward. When the student council decision is called the constitution, we definitely haven't tackled each other in the past. I'm a trustee, I think. I was the one who helped your team... ...and I am encouraged to do something, you have come to this place. That day your project was more horrible than you did. I was badly ill, but I was relieved to be a trustee. I am really happy that I could come to this place. Yes, partying is a part of our club. It's very refreshing, I always say to my friends. I think we should get on with some of our friends. Now you are in the Mokad-e-Sat, you are in the Dyer's world, you are in the Aidee's, you are in the Medinus, you are in the Osman and all of you are in the Romanism. We have come to a conclusion. As the names of these Dyer's are the ones we see. You are actually a political leader. The Republic of the Republic is a part of our Phegan Berra family. We have been a political leader. In the Dyer's side, the Dyer's enemies are the Seraphite tribe. So Seraphite tribe is the Seraphite tribe. The CEO of the CEO of the Pagan Laws came to us and got us an important part of the party. So you should take your political coordinates from your perspective on that. In Turkey, it's like a story about who you were talking about in the category of who you were. It's a very similar story. But there are some interpretations. There are certain interpretations that have a great influence on politics. Every time your personal experience, your personal experience, your personal experience, your personal experience, your personal experience, your personal experiences, your experiences, your experiences, your experiences. are the ones in the order of the Prime Minister Putin, the ones in the parliament, the ones that are responsible for the rights. For this reason, I will explain this to the Armenians. People who are on the verge of being the Governor of Moscow have already heard the saying to the Prime Minister for the National Security Council, and to the Giuliani. I am talking about the consequences of the conference. The UNATEM is very basic. In the world, we need to do the same thing in every field. The ability to win the Khabiliyat. It is a very difficult task for us to get into the LaiKo. We are not the only people who are ready to test LaiKo. We all have some work to do, but we have a lot of time to do it. We are in another direction of the terrorist attack. So you can't see a port in your room where you have to enter an escape and escape. You will see a security guard and a guard. You can't see a guard. I can't reach the aim. I am a Russian, a sergeant. I knew it. I was only riding a motorcycle and I was breaking into the t-shirt. I couldn't reach. Was he jealous of me? He might be jealous of me. I don't remember. So, it was their duty to do the job. But, they asked, What was the reason for this? The state has developed a business. You have become a state of the government. We are not talking about it. We are a state of the state. We have sold all the mechanisms. In those days, the government has been under the same rules as the government. The government has also been under the same rules as well as the other men. They actually had wild men on their team. But in all cases, they were never anyone else. When they were anyone they were the ones who pushed their everybody. All the men were idiots and they were all eligible, as they were all individuals, who were a power before. They were only the fake ones. They were the fake ones, the fake ones, fighting against each other, they were killed on the streets of the city and they got killed. As a result, the people of the city were very angry. This is why we all got the same country as the Kurds. We have to produce some valuable items. We need to cut the items. We need to use the scroll. You'll put the scroll in. The reveals are included. The reveals are coming. I'm not joking. Why do you keep saying that? Let's just talk about the history. Let's talk about the history. Let's talk about this category. It's like this. If you don't go out, you will be punished for this punishment. There is such a burden. Everyone wants to do something. All people... ...can do things like this. But this is not the end. People can do it by themselves. ...this was the time of the Ejriyat and Liya Kat Haadisess. They came to Ejriyat. He came for Ejriyat. He was not going to see him if he was home. Thank you. Aya, congratulations! I say thank you very much. You're amazing! We didn't have the chance to take the project, and we were not allowed to take it. You're going to take it out of your mind. I mean, it's like that. I mean, I didn't take it out of my mind, but everyone has a great love for it. From social media. I hope you'll see you in the next episode. Thank you.
