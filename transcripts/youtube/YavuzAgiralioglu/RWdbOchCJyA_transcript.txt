You The We ...but actually it's a military unit. So you can take the government's unit... ...to have an answer to what you have been waiting for... ...and to show what you have been waiting for. If you ask a few questions about this, you can ask a few questions. Now, we have a question for you. Now, in the head-to-head of the UN... ...there is one important thing that suits them. You have the Turkish government's unit, the Turkish government's... ...Tasdaruf, the Turkish government's Chinese government. Here, there are some Turkish states here. For example, Katiil state, for example, Ceberub state, for example, Tiran state, for example, this democracy that can be done by the government, is a burden to protect the citizens of PKK. So, you say everything that comes to the state, but in the 30th century, there is no way out of the terror organization of a political party. But, you are not allowed to go out of the terror organization. But a government position in the PKK was in the state of KURMAI. The state of Terao's country is a metro center. Many cities have been closed in the US. The state of Turkey, the state of Turkey, and the state of Terao's country are in the state of KURMAI. Of course, you can say that it is a natural democracy. So, you can say that it is a place where the state of KURMAI is, but we said that the state of KURMAI was not able to do it here. Since the head of the HDP party has a particular issue in Turkey, the head of the HDP is under 600 parliament. The head of the HDP is the head of the HDP, the head of the HDP. This is actually a key issue. But these are key issues. This is a democratic issue. In our opinion, the head of the HDP is always a person. That person, I think, is called the chief leader of the party. We, for example, had not given the Temthinking, of course. The Temthinking was very hard, but we all remember how this was happening. The government has aimed to eliminate the Ottoman-Ukrainian Television, The President of the Republic of Turkey, the president of Turkish-United States of America, the State, and the State Council. The fact that he wrote this letter to the president of the U.S. is that the work he did today is going to be a little worse. So, what did you do to this? For example, you didn't see the news about the TV series. Now, you can say that there is an agreement with the TV series. We brought this letter from the president of the U.S. and we brought this letter from the president of the U.S. We said that we were going to die in the U.S. We said we were going to die in the democracy. But we are afraid of the fact that we are going to die in the democracy. I will give you a more detailed explanation. We think that the president of the U.S. is like a terrorist organization. Or, as the organization that doesn't put the press in the terrorist organization is like a terrorist organization. That is why we are trying to make a very difficult decision. I am trying to make a very difficult decision. You are not going to be able to make a decision as a party. Because you are going to be able to make a big mistake in the media. Yes. You are going to be able to make a decision as a party. So, going to be able to8% to get this Was pretty... You are telling me that this question is correct. Yes, right? Generally, there is a fact that I was trying to make a very difficult decision You are trying to make a decision. Isn't there a fact that I was not supposed to make a very difficult decision? Yes, that's right. Do you want to make a decision? Security is against the law. We went to a system that was in the middle of the table and this was a difficult one for you. We have a set in mind. Do you see democratic democracy as a state? Yes. We had a new rule that was presented in the past. We had a first and second model of this model. There are a different way in which the ulcerative cultural stability is being raised. When we areola, private state is not the state's state. It is the scale of 5 thousand years, a thousand years, a thousand years and a thousand YouTubles. Anyway, we are a little bit of a fool. This is why Honestly, we have an electric state. My father said that he has formed a state called the state as children, and we have an expanded state in them. We have 71 to 81 billion years, and it is a huge energy, And he said, OK, but today we are not in a single state. We are not in a single state. Today we called a model. We called it a model. We said that this is a society, a man is in a position. We said that we will bring a group together. We said that they said that they should be propaganda. We said that they should be propaganda. When the elections were planned, and the elections were a little different, because the government's system was making progress. We are still aware of the progress. But that is what we call a project with a state of which we are giving our state. Now, this is what is happening, We are living in these high-quality homes for a year, and we are going to start building up two days or so. We are going to get some energy, we are going to change the future, but we will not save our energy from energy. The teachers of the denture Ministry, in essence, will not stay with the members of the Ministry for a long time, they will stay for a long time. First, the government immediately obeys the first government, the first government office then obeys the second government. The first government of the Turkish Academy, Turkish people are finding their own wealth. Today, it seems that it seems that they will become rich. The costs are their own money. That is why the people are finding their own money. Including some people are finding their own money. They are taking care of the people. So, it is important to consider the prices of the first part. All of the prices are the same as before. But now, all of our names are 10, and 17. It is a new model of the country. Is it because of this? Yes, it is. Have you ever talked about this? Yes, but how much more do we need to make a decision? And we are trying to make a decision. For example, if we are to receive the health certificate further, we are not willing to receive the certificate. We are not willing to receive the certificate. We are not willing to receive the certificate further. We are not willing to receive it. So, we don't have to take it seriously. So, the first priority is to take the responsibility of the Mansur-iyah. It's not good, it's not bad. Three days after the rain is over, the sun is going up. You have to be careful and make sure that everything is fine. It's not a bad thing. People say he doesn't want the place to go. I'm saving you right now. I want to make a deal with it with my partner. We can never be Adil. We've been faced with an accident. We can never be Adil, but we'll get Adil, We will no longer cross theé©¬. But we can't be a king without our meat, we will have to walk from the roots to the roots. We will fall from that branch, the roots can be a seed, but not a seed. We will go to Turkey and make a protest. We are not able to attack the roots, we will go to the roots rather than run from the roots. We can't attack the roots. We will go to the roots, saying that we are a transverse in our nation, 2021, We are not talking about the problem with the problem of the political propaganda in that way. But we are not talking about the problem. Now, in Turkey, with the question of security and terrorism, I will ask you something. For example, a G.S.K. The press has made a public opinion. It has not been translated into public opinion. This is one of the public opinion. Ahmed Tukh, who has chosen something like this, The blackout is more than 200. The blackout is more than 70. And there is no problem with the real blackout. It's been 2015 for over 20 years. What's the difference between the blackout and the blackout? There is no. There is a problem right now. There's a problem. I want to discuss this again. This is the issue of the blackout. You saw the news, the news, and the news, and the good news. But the government is still looking forward to it. The HDP was a hDP that was established in the US. We can see that there is no such thing in the US. The issue of terror or the issue of the state is that the situation is not the same. The issue of terror or the issue of the human rights is that the situation is not the same. If there is a problem, it would be possible. The main scale is that he has that variety. And even since you are part of the model, they are the process. So they are also the process. Now, let's just add them together. You can get a set of it on Istanbul. And I had to tell you. One of the qualities of the model is that the model of the model has a different structure, the sharing of the model has a different structure. This model has a particular mindset, whether this model has a specific structure or a character. We all know that if you add the model of this model, The head of our head will stay in this meeting. The head of the head of the head is like a shadow one. He wants to kill himself with his sword, but he can't say this. If you have a sword, I can kill myself. If you have a sword, you can kill yourself. For example, even if you wear a black hat, your head will spin. You are not going to get another head in the head of the head. We will do some details about it. If we put it in the state, if the state is able to control the country, then the HDP will look at the situation in which the situation is affected. But this is not a matter of discussion. Now, Suleiman, let's say, we have a lot of pressure on Suleiman in the last few hours. Yes. Yes, we have a lot of pressure on the government. Actually, Suleiman said that this is also a matter of discussion. He has a serious political problem with his own discussion. I mean, if you don't want to join us, you won't be able to do it. But when we turn around like this, we have to be aware of our secrets. HDP is not the case with terror, but it is completely closed in the first place. Now, you are saying that everything is related to HDP, it is a very serious issue for the citizens of Belediye. We are discussing the case with terror. We are discussing the case with terror organizations and we are not sure if we can use the terror organizations in Belediye. Now, we can't say that you won't go to the elections. You will go to the elections, the citizens of the country are going to go to the elections. We are saying that we should go to the propaganda. We should go to the propaganda center, to the propaganda center. To the propaganda center. You will be able to do it. So, this is why we are trying to turn the propaganda into a propaganda center. We have made a statement about it. For example, we see the statement. We have to be aware of the good part of the public. I see HDP as something. Actually, there are no criminal cases. I want to ask you about it. What do you see as your conscience? The security. The security of the public. What do you see as the statement of the people of the KÃ¶che-Lazar? The 7-year-old people from there. Today, they are there. Three days later, I thought that they are working with men. I saw that they are looking at the security of the UN. They were looking at the press and the media. They were looking at the media. I have a question. I have an answer to this question. I'm involved in the study of the good party in the elections. As a result, I have an interesting question. What is your question? I have an answer to this question. I'm talking about the young people. And the young people of democracy is like a thousand-year-old who are a big group of young people. But for example, for example, one person or the older one of them is a child. They say they don't sort out a warning. That's right. They live in terminologies. They dress up like involved, they wear some sort of underwear, they wear some clothes like these. They wear something that's boring. They have nice partners, they are from abroad. This team, they don't want to send me any live message, They don't want to be in a democracy. Because there are the original ones. He is a media player. They want to call things new. We do not want to give this idea to the new thing. What democracy can be seen. We can move towards the destruction of the Nehoku Koon. What can we do? We can use the materialized force. It is the state that made the state something different. So we can be very understanding. We are just saying that we cannot make democracy with the materialized force. Democracy is based on affording democracy that gives the immigrants to use democracy as a way to get rid of democracy and to become a terrorist. Or we can don't have enough time to do this. But this is not a big issue which is difficult for them. I wasn't it's hard for a terrorist to make deaths. Okay. Do you have any right to be sexy? We're actually going to be sexy! But it's not because we are doing that! No, I mean, if you're wrong then don't do anything! Do you like to say that you don't need this membership information? These membership keeps communicating with these members! We are doing this. We are doing the same thing. If we can do the same thing, we can do it. If we can do the same thing, if we can do it, we can do it. But I am sure that this is a possibility for the government to expect it. This is a possibility. I think this possibility is a possibility for the government. If we say that there are three different types of security measures, this is the only way to solve the problem. We can't see any security measures. We have to give more information to them. We might not be able to see the natural security measures. I think the most important thing is that we can't take advantage of the security measures. It is a very important thing. We want to see how the security measures are going to be. What are they doing? What are the biggest enemies of the state? Are they going to destroy our camps by spending time with the terrorists? But should the democracy of the United States be successful then? If the government of Idhars doesn't have the chance to impose their Trumps, it should be too difficult to make it happen, It's a disgrace in this culture. I want to say this. I'm not going to destroy the majority of the country! I'm going to be the only terrorist I'm going to be able to control. I'm going to accept the country that is going to destroy the war. I said, if he had saved this subject, I would have been able to help him. I have already shown the reason why I was able to help him. So I was able to help him. I was waiting for the decision on the Turkish side. I can't wait. In order to prevent this from happening, the United States should not cut the democracy. I will go to the people, I will choose, I will choose the people, I will look at the people, I will play. So, in this situation, the law of the democracy is in the heart of the democracy. The democracy of the democracy is in other things, you know. That's why, it's not what we are trying to do. But we are trying to solve the problem of the AK Parties. We are trying to solve the problem of the AK Parties. We did it before that we were more serious about the crisis. Well the cover said let's say we were going out. We were asking for a stop and they were talking about our house. They were talking about the cover and they could talk about getting out. That was just a strange idea. Alright. There are many things you always tell your wife... ...by making a woman stupid and being paradoxical about yourself. But see, how do you think about money? I don't know why, I don't know how else things were put on the table. I just want to ask you one thing, they will open the table and we will talk about what happened to the public in the coming years. They wanted to give us a close look at how people have made public schools. They went through the streets. They said, it was 70,000 to 70,000 people, the city is busy with washing them. Now, it's time for the holidays to come. They won't let you down again. That's why you won't be able to get out of this situation after this. These holidays will go on like this. There will be a lot of trouble, a lot of trouble. Do you think this is going to happen? How are you going to do this? I think it's going to be a great deal. It's going to be a great deal. All in Turkey, we can actually say we need to give much of the benefits of these holidays. Turkey should be slowly in a way that is what makes the Leder's new destination. There's nothing else to do with the Leder's new name. There's nothing more to do with the Leder's new name. There's nothing more to do with the Leder's new name, now it's time to give something and come back. There's nothing more to do with the Leder's new names. And that's how I think we have to give something just like a new name. We have to work in our schools, we will bring a Sistema to our country. There are. The mood is up, it's not over yet. Let's continue. Right away. Something we said 17 years ago, in fact, we have a bit of a party issue in the past. We are not looking at it as the party. We need to keep up with the situation of the party. Albert, two days ago. The last 8-7 days of the party, most of the time, Asia, the Islamic Republic, if they were able to maintain the level of their own crisis, they would be at the age of 17, so they would be able to maintain the levels of their lockdown. Very brave, very brave. This is important for them. Now, I'm giving a little help to those who are in the field of society. We are forming a very dangerous government, having a very brave family, and learning the things that they are doing through their work. But we are learning them anyway. Now, I would like to tell you the people who are in the field of service, They were the ones who had to bring them to the same place. Actually, the state is not only the one who is responsible for it, but also the one who is responsible for the decision to see it. Actually, from one point of view, people are more concerned about the existence of human beings. But the people who are in love with humans are very bad. Some people say, we are two million in sex. We are living in a place. We have no other way. We have no other choice. We don't want to be afraid to enter the place. But we are learning. We are trying to think, but if you want to think, we are beautiful. We are just a part of it. We are not doing what we believe. We believe that we are going to become a great man. We believe that you have been a very talented and talented person. You know, we all say that a lot. But... ...it's all good, all good. It's a 17 year old age problem. You'll be able to talk to the sociologist. You'll be able to talk to him. You'll be able to start with the age of 17. Why? It's a party. If you look at our private society or our private society, you'll be a public person. But by the age of 17, the UN, the UN, it's been a 17 year. It's been a 17 year. So, basically, the age of this age ...if there is a state where they can be the center of the country. A state is not a state of the country. Just a state of security, I mustn't test it. We're not talking about the government. We know our efforts, we don't know. We're not doing anything stupid. We don't care about the weather. We don't care about what is going on in Turkey. We can't do anything about it. But we'll ask you for a few questions. I would like to ask you a few questions. and we will see what will happen. What will happen? How will this incident happen? It will happen. You will see it, we will see it. We will check your information, see what happened. What did the people of Istanbul conquer against the old fashioned society and its new society is like an old generation. First of all, today the old society is.. It is like an old generation. An old society is like an old generation. And in this case, we are curious, how our society will view the whole Soviet Union, You see, what is the economy of Turkey, what is the economy of the EU, what is democracy? If the social world is not working, there is a place where there is no place. This is the main point, because you said something new about the New Year's Eve. Now, let's say that the old days are like this. The old days are like this. But it is the old days. There are also the old days. Look, the first step is to say that this is a very important thing, we said in the press conference, that we said that we have done a lot of big things in this territory. We did a lot of big things in that time. We did not understand the people's psychology. We came back to this point. We did not finish our territory. Now, today, we still have to read this book, in fact, in Turkey, we have a new generation, and in total, all the countries of the world, the democracy, the work of the new generation, the country, the country, the parliament, the election, the country, the country, do not live in the same way. In fact, we do not think that the other countries are in the same way. Do not think like this. And the situation is similar to the situation. What will happen to all the people in Turkey? We are very happy now. For example, Tayyip Bey is a HDP, he is a PKK, I am a mayor, I said, he is a very different country from 2002. We are also a problem with the HDP, so I see a political problem in the capital, but I would not agree with the HDP, I am a mayor. I am a head of the HDP, I am a mayor of the HDP, I am a head of the HDP, but every HDP is not a head of the HDP, in fact, I say that it is a bad thing. It is the first time that you have a head of the HDP, because you will have a very important case. If you talk about terrorism, you do not see theery. I don't see the shutdown that you can stop being called a Kurd. It is not that they are Kurds. You can say that you're a Kurd. You can say straight, but you're the one who is the strongest in the world. At this point, I am not interested in finding the right to talk about such an issue. So, the GDP now is in the middle of the tank. It's over 800,000, and there's more terrorist in it. The GDP is over 500,000. It's over 600,000,000. That's not what you're going to do. We'll not give the government the government the right way, but a government will not allow that to be elected. I just want to make sure that the people are doing it. From the party, from the party, from the party, from the party, so that's just a cute girl, she lost her head when she started to choose her. I'm asking people right now. Sinan, this guy is in the Yozgat. Okay. You're going to tell her that you're the one who thinks this is important. So I want to give you a solution. Finally, you're going to make a person, what would be the problem? What would be the problem of those guys's head? What would you say about this? What is his reason for it? What is his reason? The problem is that if we have this issue of the crime, but if you are in a hurry to become a lawyer, we can't make it to the end of the case. It is not like that. It is very comfortable to say that we were talking about the elections. How did they say that they were talking about the elections? It is a huge risk. What is it? I was not surprised. I was surprised at what time was it? What did I say? I was not surprised. It was only 770 years. It is a crisis. There are 173 people in Istanbul who will slow down, they will not be able to accept our exam results. They will not be able to accept our exam results. Because they haven't received a mandatory teacher's policy until now. They are not able to accept the ability to accept their challenges. You shouldn't say the same thing, because we have many lying in this area. In the case of murder, we have a lot of things that we have to pay for. We have to pay for the murder. We have a whole lot of things to pay for. The government has to pay for the murder. We need to pay for the murder. We have to pay for the murder. It's not a big deal. but it is a serious issue, the situation is very serious. There is no need to turn it into a challenge, or to temperatures between the country and friendship between the two, which are not reasonable, such as the government is not available. On the European side of the government, we are looking at this part of the country. We can control our minds and all our rights. On the country, the general government is not the government. That's why they are doing things. They are not the people. So, on the Left, on the Left, on the right of the government, we know that they are not the government. The question is, what are the advantages of the Kuralites? Who is the Kuralite? There are certain advantages. We are in the different ways. Because we have many different things. One of the reasons is that in this time, the Amsel army with the 5th movement of the Bina was the 50-50th movement of the Bina, There is a major problem with this. There is a huge problem with this. What's the problem? There's a small problem. We will make your fingers melt... You won't get in trouble. We will make your fingers brushing together with you countries. We will create a plan against each other. It will fall octeticles. We will rathe each other with both hands and fingers. We will create a plan against each other. We will not be trying... ...dep?'s trends, in the future. The system you find in ainned Buddhist Empire is not taken into account. In meditation practice, you will practice Zealah Yiddler out of the practice. In meditation, we used to practice Deus Babaji 180. We did the meat, we made it by 800 times. So we made the Thai products, we made 3 kinds of meat. Now, the meat is not cooked in the pot. We are using it for millets. Our friends are also using millets. They say that the meat is not a meat. We are doing a meat-like process. We are not doing a lot of meat. We are doing a lot of meat. We are doing a lot of meat-like process. We are doing something. There are a lot of different sounds in the Uygun songs. The chords are very good, the comfort is very good. It's a studio that starts to use the sound. A little bit of music. A little bit of music, a little bit of music. It's a great song. The music is made by the people. I'm telling you this. My friends, I'm sorry. You are very grateful. We are not going to read your opinion. For example, we tell you something that we don't have a opinion about. We do no have a opinion about it. So, I say to the people who are interested in this, you have to be grateful. You have lost your old age. You have lost your old uniform, your style, its style and the atmosphere. You have a lot of stuff there. As you can see, you can answer if you say your style. We are looking at the same things as the usual days. We see that we're seeing it. That means there's nothing to say about it. That's why... Now, the system is a year. This year, the same with the year that we see... ...the Aksat brothers, the Aksat brothers, are involved in the big election. As part of the militants, they see it in their eyes. But they don't say it. You have to say these things about this crime. Are you aware of the difference between the Aksat brothers and the leaders of the militants? We are saying that we have a healthy life, my friends. We are saying that we are in the same state. We are saying that we will be in the same state. We are saying that the health care is the right thing for the economy, but the economy of the AK Parties is now being pushed away by the Umbars. So the AK Parties, I mean, we are talking about the most powerful coronavirus in the world of politics. I just want to say that the company that launched the AK Parties is all over the country. I have created an AK Parties machine with my own company. It is a bit like a little bit of a situation I have. People say that it's really sert. It's not my own company, but it is the company that's writing in your Party program. You write in your Party program. You tell your friends, tell them, tell them, you're the one who's in this world. Now, part of this is that I actually want to show you how good the subjects are. This is what it is. It's not a good subject but a good job. They are good subjects. Type in is a good subject. It's a good subject that we can learn about the content of this subject in the past 1000 years. It's a good subject that we can talk about. It's a good subject. But look at the question of Istanbul elections. Istanbul elections are the most positive things to talk about with the people of the West. The West was the second vote of the West in the West. The West was the first to vote with the people of the West. They were all under the impression of the West. So, I don't think it's important to talk about the West with the people of the West. The West was the one to blame with the people of the West. All of us dearaha, dear sergeant, thanks son, thank you all. Even we have the same kebbing given to my wife as well. Only before the new month of the grad student in education have been promoted so what íë is always changing as a teacher. Now we well read, heeled, as a teacher reacted to our audience fans. But we are not in the same state as our weaknik in general. Just as the participants said, we are not gonna make anything absurd to the students. In our case the indigo movement always builds our hearts. Now let me tell you something. Beautiful words, time is over. The things you do is perfect. The things you do are very important to you. People will be very important to you. They will be very important to you. But you don't have a religion. Because religion is the way you are. We have a different religion. You have a different religion to your children. That's why I am talking about it. What is your main religion? It's something like a rule. It is a religion. But you say it is your own choice. You are doing what others are doing. I mean, I'm saying this, you are going to Turkey. The problem is the end of the world. Turkey is getting a huge amount of money from the government. The big part of the world is that it is not a part of the world. This is not a part of the world. Every country, every place, every place of the world, the city, the city of the city, the city of the city, the city of the city, What they can do in hours is not a place you cannot work with. Who can help you now? ilt acne treatment would pile up, will take 2 million tons of risk Harefil, Ila, Ila, S ikke, We will be able to do that. You will see that, in my opinion, with the new issue, the development of the old will be a big energy, and this country will also be able to get it. I saw you were talking about this. No, no, I'm not. I think the youth of the youth of the new generation and the influence of the political system are very different. I think that 90 years have to be criminalized by saying the same things. We have seen people who can't be bothered by the state or the bad ones or the evil ones or evil ones. Let me ask you about your questions. You want to talk about the situation in Syria and the UN today. Why are you telling us this? We will put a box in Syria, we will put it on the US side. and the decision was to go to the court, you know, the situation was so bad. And what happened to the US and the US? Now there is a new plan, the car is being sold. Why did you say that? Tell me. What is the problem with the climate? Is this climate the problem of the Kayyum, the climate of the Bahane, the climate of the country? We put it in our own way. We've heard that there are a lot of big things in our daily lives. There is such a big problem. I will tell you a little bit about this problem. There is a fear that there will be a problem that will be solved by the military. There is a fear that this problem will be solved by the military. When there is a state ofness, the air is not clear at all. There is something called space communication There is a space where we do not even know about it. We have a space where we can ask for useful information, We are engaged in this, so we can say that we are engaged in something like that. We can say that we are engaged in the same way. So, we want to be engaged in all the processes. For example, if you remember the Taipin Gaye Branson line, this one, it is in this place. When you see a few friends, you say that you have to go to your parents the same way. We said this. That was it, my friend. We went there, the door was open, the break was open. We went to the table and the door was open. The roof was open. There are similar details about the technology we tried to show. We didn't. We could say that we were in a situation where we were in that situation. There is a lot to do. If you don't do anything, you can go to other places. If you don't do anything, you have to test them. Then you will get bored. As you know, you try to cook your chicken into freshness, it shows how to cook it with sour rice! You ask about the time you cook the chicken, for it to be done, and you find a sarkir fish with the rest of it. When you do it quick you will try to understand it. You can do the same. So, this does actually make the ingredients and you are aware of the difference between the ingredients and what you can do. We have all the things we have come to the end. We believe that we have a lot of hope and we have a lot of hope. We have to work hard to improve our old-fashioned skills. This is our fear. The question is, now, the question of the question is the fear of the question. We start with the question of the question. We start with the question. As you can see, when we talk about terrorism, we can see that there is a situation in the end of the Taliban's last year, and we can't say that there is a situation outside of the Taliban. The biggest fear of the Taliban is that we have 60 or 70 years of NATO. We are trying to find out the biggest fear of the Taliban. We are trying to make all the problems that we have in NATO. We are trying to make all the problems that we have in America. since in the world, a representative of the country had been trying to apply for the government. The American government is not going to do anything like that. Because they managed to create a finalist there using their power to evaluate the current situation, and they must be someone else's government's own country. In addition, if a coup was made, a way would be created. I mean, American Nordar, DayaÅta, MÃ¼cadela, adÄ±na beklediÄi iÅi TÃ¼rkiye'de bir kolor diye yaptÄ±rabilirsin. TÃ¼rkiye'de 60-70 yÄ±ldÄ±k NATO mÃ¼ddefi ki bir Ã¼lkeye. Ki kolor diye yaptÄ±rabilirsin, orada bir pekaka devletine kurulsun diye. Ve Åon bin tÄ±rsilah vereceksen mÃ¼ddefi eklik hukukunu ayaklar altÄ±na alarak. DolayÄ±sÄ±yla bizim endiÅelerimizi besleyen Åey Åu. Ä°Ã§eride ki bu tÃ¼r organizasyonlarÄ±n dÄ±ÅarayÄ±la olan... Karimler yani, evet, evet, evet, evet, olabilir. Yani ona bir soru iÅareti koyduk, Ã§Ã¼nkÃ¼ bu bizim en bÃ¼yÃ¼k korkumuz... Bu iÃ§eride TÃ¼rk devletinin iÃ§indeki huzursuzluÄu yarÄ±nlarda... BakÄ±n bu program, buna mehaz olsun. Ben bu programda sÃ¶ylemiÅtim diye bir Åirin anda konuÅurken ben bunu sÃ¶ylemiÅtim diyeyim. Bizim TÃ¼rkiye'nin iÃ§ini karÄ±ÅtÄ±rma organizasyonunun en Ã¶nemli bir henktaÅÄ± sÄ±nÄ±rÄ±mÄ±zÄ±n altÄ±nda bir pekaka devletine kuruluÅ imkanÄ± verilmezdir. Ondan sonrasÄ± TÃ¼rkiye'de Ã§ok daha kolay tasarlanabilecektir. Bu korkumuz dolayÄ± o cÃ¼mleyi kurduk. Ä°nÅallah biz yanÄ±lÄ±rÄ±z, yani bu bizim korkumuz. Yani dÄ±ÅarÄ±ya bir inÅallah biz yanÄ±lÄ±rÄ±z. O anlamda sadece Åunun bilinmesi lazÄ±m. Biz demokrasi herkese her iÅ dedin yapma imkanÄ± veren bir sistemdir diye savunduÄumuz bir Åey deÄil. Memcutlar iÃ§erisinde insan oÄlunun eline geÃ§irdiÄi en ehven, en makul yÃ¶netim tarzÄ± budur. Bundan daha iÅini bulamadÄ±k. Ama bunun hukukul teminatÄ± altÄ±nda tutmak zorundayÄ±z. Bunu muhafaza etmek hassasiyetimizi konuÅuyoruz sadece Åu... Siyasetin terÃ¶rize edilmesini Ã¶nÃ¼ne geÃ§mek istiyoruz ama bu bizim Ã§ok zor konuÅabildiÄimiz bir alan biliyorsunuz. Sadece bir cÃ¼mle rica ediyorum. 3 ildi atanan valileri, kayyumlarÄ±, kayyumlarÄ± ya da neyse bu konuda da tartÄ±Åmakta, eset, esat meseresi gibi. Ä°yipati olarak tanÄ±yacak mÄ±sÄ±nÄ±z? NasÄ±l? TanÄ±yacak mÄ±sÄ±nÄ±z? Yani muhatapalÄ± tanÄ±yacak mÄ±sÄ±nÄ±z? TanÄ±mak, tanÄ±mak. TanÄ±mak ki tasarrufunuz yok bizim normalde. Bu ana yasalde, yetki kullanÄ±ldÄ±, valiler kayÄ±m olarak atlandÄ±. Tayyip ve burada bir ceza aldÄ±. CezaasÄ± bÃ¼tÃ¼n safalar elebittikten sonra, biliyorsunuz ceza evine gitti. Yani beklendi yargÄ± tarif sÃ¼reci de beklendi. Ondan sonra ceza evine gitti, ceza evine gitti, zaman belediye de Ali Mufid GÃ¼rtana'yÄ± seÃ§miÅlerdi. DolayÄ±sÄ±yla sÃ¼recim butÃ¼lÃ¼s Ã¼stelik ceza evine gitti, zaman Tayyip Bey yargÄ± kararÄ±na raÄmeni itirazettik. Tayyip Bey'in bugÃ¼n arkasÄ±ndaki siyasal desteÄin ilk merkezi yargÄ± kararÄ±na raÄmen kadre uÄradÄ±na inanmÄ±ÅlÄ±ktÄ±r. DolayÄ±sÄ±yla mÃ¼him bir Åeydir bu. Demokrasilerin temsil imkanlarÄ±nÄ± daha Ã§ok muhafaza eden bir hukuk devleti ilkeleriyle yaÅama mecburiyetim vardÄ±r. Ama biz ÅÃ¶yle, siyasete ÅÃ¶yle yapmÄ±yoruz sÃ¼nanÄ±m. Bilesiniz, tanÄ±mÄ±yorum, etmiyorum, ilgilenmiyorum, gelmiyorum, kÃ¼stÃ¼m, oynamÄ±yorum. Falun biz iyi part olarak bÃ¶yle yapmÄ±yoruz, biz insanlarÄ±n gÃ¶zlerinin iÃ§ine bak. Bak, bak, inandÄ±ÄÄ±mÄ±z dolarÄ±z, sÃ¶ylemeye inanÄ±yoruz. Yani aslÄ±nda iÅimiz zafteyil bizim. Problems, Ã§Ã¶zmek zorundayÄ±z, parlamentonum vazifesi budur, basinum vazifesi budur. YaÅanabilir, bir TÃ¼rkiye idealine su taÅÄ±yacaÄÄ±z. Ya hep beraber taÅÄ±yacaÄÄ±z. Yani baÅka tÃ¼rlÃ¼ olmaz ki, ben kuÅbirinizi tanÄ±mÄ±yorum. Efendim, ah haber, Åimdi haber veriyor. Ya Ã¶yle cÃ¼mleler kuruyorlar ki, diyorlar ki, bÃ¶yle problemlerimiz var bizim. TÃ¼rk yurdununu hakikat yurdur diye yapacaÄÄ±z. Yani kimden laf duyduk basÄ±ndan? Ya bizim basinimizin ÅÃ¶yle bir sicri olmasÄ±n mÄ±? TÃ¼rk basinundan bir haber duyurmuÅ da mutlaka doÄurduk. Bence ah haberi cittiy almanlar var. Ya Ã¶yle, uÃ§una Ã§Ä±ldÄ±rÄ±yorum yani. Bak bu kadar satsule gitti aslÄ±nda. Ha, bu kadar valla cittiy almayÄ±n. Fek Ã§ok teÅekkÃ¼r ederim. Espirisi bir yana. GerdiÄiniz katÄ±ldÄ±ÄÄ±nÄ±z iÃ§in Ä° Parti'nin ne dÃ¼ÅÃ¼ndÃ¼ÄÃ¼nde seyirciler aktarmÄ±Å olduk gÃ¼nÃ¼ Åeklinde. SayÄ±n Yavuz. Allah razÄ± olsun o aÄÄ±rladÄ±k. Ãyle dediÄiniz iÃ§in zor gibi geliyor aslÄ±nda. AslÄ±nda kolay mÄ±? Evet. Yavuz aÄÄ±r, Ali OÄlu saÄ olsun Ä° Parti sÃ¶zcÃ¼sÃ¼ bugÃ¼n geldi. SorularÄ±mÄ±z cevaplandÄ±rdÄ±. Ä°zlediÄiniz iÃ§in size de Ã§ok teÅekkÃ¼r ediyorum. Ãok teÅekkÃ¼r ederim.
