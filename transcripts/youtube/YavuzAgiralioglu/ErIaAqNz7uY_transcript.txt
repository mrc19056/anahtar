I'm going to get a drink. But what the hell are you talking about? These are the first time you've ever believed someone. What do you want me to do? What did you do? For the world's most powerful and precious, we will be the ones who will be the best of all. And for all our sins. Let's go! This first day, Hacan, is all about love and faith. A very good time.
